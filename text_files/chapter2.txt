Reduced to Legacy
Chapter Two
























“Brother[e]?”
        Awakened by the noise, Trent squinted his crusted eyes, overwhelmed by pain. His stomach throbbed, trying to make sense of the darkness encompassing him. Skies, he cursed. Am I dreaming? Or is this some kind of cruel illusion?
Shifting, Trent winced as pain shot through him, a harsh reminder of reality. His fingers brushed against rough bandages, igniting flashes of memory – Karia's embrace, the cold floor, his betrayal.
Trent's thoughts swirled in a maelstrom of guilt and loss, each memory of Karia a sharp sting of what might have been. A silent scream echoed within him, a cry for the rebellion that had crumbled to dust. His pulse didn't quicken in panic but sank in a slow, heavy rhythm of defeat, the weight of his failure pressing down like a physical force.
But then Trent froze, a dark thought seizing him. Where was Karia? He felt as though his gut had been stuffed down his throat. Without seeing anything, his eyes darted around, frantic. He felt his heart hammer in his chest, a drumbeat of anxiety. 
        “Brother?” It came clearer this time, sharp and urgent, shaking him out of his spiraling worry.
Trent’s eyes snapped open: he knew that voice. “Sasha? Is that you?” His voice was raspy, dry and strained. Desperate, he strained his eyes against the dim light, yearning for a glimpse of a familiar silhouette. Pain flared with each movement, but it paled against the need to confirm the reality of his sister's presence. Tenderly, he crawled towards the noise, pleading to be able to hear it again. Despite his gnawing wound and drained strength, Trent pushed forward. My family! Trent sniffed, tears in his eyes. My family is alive! 
Maybe, just maybe, he had made the right choice in that blasted throne room.
“Can you not see me?” Sasha's voice trembled with worry. Oh, Sasha! Trent rejoiced. She was always replete with compassion, and he could always count on her to be by her side. 
Shakily, Trent pushed himself upright, his vision a whirlpool of colors that gradually coalesced into discernible shapes – and then, miraculously, into the faces of his family. There they stood, in the dimly lit cave, just outside his cell: his mother and father and his beloved sisters Sasha and Selean.
And King Icar.
He stood behind them all with his arms folded. He appeared as an amused spectator at a zoo.
Ignoring the tyrant, Trent staggered towards the cell’s bars. Stretching his arms through them, he reached for Sasha with a desperation that eclipsed his hunger for freedom. Her eyes were wide and brimming with tears as she clasped his hand. “We are here, brother. All of us,” she comforted, her voice a soothing whisper.
        “I know,” Trent answered, tenderly overjoyed. “I know.”
In that moment, as Trent gazed upon his family, the gnawing guilt that had clung to his soul began to dissolve. Deep inside his soul he knew that for his family, he would brave anything because they were his everything. A gentle peace, warm and soothing, seeped through the cracks of his battered heart, dispelling the icy scars of fear and regret. The familiarity of his family brought a new warmth. He noticed how his father's brow bunched together, revealing a smile of chipped teeth, the rosy flush of his mother's cheeks, or the way Selean's nose crinkled in uncertainty. Oh, the simple, profound joy of seeing them once more!
Yet, even as this joy swelled within him, it cast a long shadow over the hidden chambers of his heart, veiling the sadness that lay buried underneath. Trent felt it: the silent echo of his betrayal to the kingdom, to his friends, and worst of all, to Karia. He pushed those thoughts away, focusing on the light coming from his family. Yet, his heart still pulsed with a sorrowful rhythm, a reminder of the cost of his survival. The price of this bittersweet reunion had not been cheap.
        “You should have done it,” Selean, Trent’s younger sister—seventeen and spotted with freckles—muttered. Her green eyes flickered up to Trent before darting back to the ground. Trent’s mother forcibly nudged her, her words quick and scolding. “Don’t you see his pain?” she chided quietly. “Don’t add to it.”
        Trent began to feel sick, and his happiness felt a little bit more hollow. His guilt had not gone away, and now it was eating at his joy. More than ever, King Icar’s presence weighed down heavily in the prison corridor. Trent’s focus wandered over to the King, as he felt his guilt feed a boiling rage. Where was Karia? If he had killed her… Trent swallowed. If the blasted King killed her then Trent would personally escort him to the depths. 
        Unfazed by Trent’s glare, Icar raised his chin, inspecting. Why is he here? Couldn’t the blasted idiot leave me alone? Didn’t he already win! Darker thoughts stormed through Trent’s mind like a whirlwind. His chest began to rise up and down as he fumed. I need to get my hands on his scrawny neck…
Sasha squeezed his hand, gently tugging him away from his anger. With one word, she dispelled his rage. “Trent.”
Trent's breath hitched, then slowly steadied as he locked eyes with Sasha. There was an unspoken understanding in her gaze, contrasting his inner turmoil. Even disheveled, her hair fell loosely around her shoulders, there was an air of composure about her that Trent had always envied but relied upon. 
Releasing Sasha's hand, Trent gently grasped her shoulders, searching her eyes for the truth. "Are you safe?" he asked, his voice low and urgent.
Sasha's response was a silent nod, her lips parting as if to speak a different truth, but no sound came. Instead, Icar’s voice filled the void. “They are under my protection, Trent. As long as I am under yours.”
Trent's nod was slow, heavy with the weight of realization and reluctant acceptance. He detested the thought of serving Icar, yet his family's safety eclipsed all other concerns. He had no other option. "Then so be it," he muttered through clenched teeth, the words tasting like ash in his mouth.
"Brother, no!" Selean cried out, her call a mix of heroic courage and teenage stupidity. Their mother sternly elbowed her, yet her expression mirrored Selean’s distress. "It is not your choice to make, Selean." Seeing his family defeated, Trent felt his heart skip a beat. If my family had been in my place, would they have made the same choice I did? 
He felt his heart sink. What if my family would have preferred to be dead for the kingdom to taste freedom? Did they even want to keep living like this? Living like puppets underneath the King? 
Trent's arms fell limply to his sides, the energy draining from him as a cold realization washed over his mind. The fire of the rebellion leader, once a roaring blaze within him, was barely a mere flicker, smothered under the weight of his new, unwanted role. He was a pawn in a game he had never wanted to play. 
        “The kingdom?” Trent inquired, seeking to find any spark of hope. “How are they?”
His father frowned. “What do you expect? It's over.”
        Trent felt as though he had been punched in the gut, but Sasha was quick to give a faint smile. Oh, how I love my sister! She was always one to uplift, thank the skies. “It’s not your fault, brother. You gave it your best.”
        “I’m sorry,” he whispered, feeling the cold grasp of defeat. “The cost was too great for me to pay.”
        “Trent, it’s okay,” Sasha comforted, peering into Trent’s haunted eyes. She noticed the conflict within him. “It’s alright.”
Tears blurred Trent's vision as he pulled Sasha close, the cruel bars of his cell a stark reminder of their incomplete reunion. They stood as a physical divide, yet symbolized so much more—the chasm between his current reality and the life he yearned for with his family. I wish I could be on the other side of these bars. I wish I could be free with my family, Trent fantasized. But hadn’t that been the purpose behind the whole rebellion? Now that dream has vanished.
Why did I betray everyone? Why couldn’t I have just ended Icar’s life? Like ghouls, the questions haunted him, threatening to numb his emotions and leave him bereft of warmth.
And then there was Karia. The mere thought of her name brought a fresh surge of tears, a painful reminder of another bond severed by his choices, another person he had left behind in his pursuit of a greater good that now seemed so elusive. The bars, cold and unyielding, stood as a testament to his failures, a barrier not just to his freedom, but to the redemption he so desperately sought. Where was Karia now? 
 “How are the people?” he asked weakly. “How are they handling… handling…” His voice trailed off, the words too heavy, too bitter to fully form. They tasted like tar, and when they reluctantly spilled from his lips, they seemed to tear apart something vital from within him. “How are they handling that I betrayed them?”
His father scoffed. “You shattered the last flicker of hope they had, Trent. Might as well have thrown your lot in with the Darkened Dawn.” With that, Trent felt a tremor in his heart. Skies, did Father always have to be so pessimistic?
His father wasn’t finished yet. He glanced down, biting his lip, and muttered under his breath, “We all believed in you…. All of us.” Trent could sense his father’s deep-rooted sorrow. Even worse, his father’s pain began to echo in the chambers of Trent’s soul. 
Sasha's voice, in contrast, was a gentle balm, though her words carried no less gravity. “The kingdom believes you to be dead, Trent. They've lost hope—all of it,” she said softly. Her eyes, brimming with a sad understanding, sought to meet his.
"The kingdom thinks I'm dead?" Trent's voice was barely above a whisper, each word laced with disbelief. He was more than a symbol: he was their protector, their voice against oppression, their hope! And now, in the eyes of his people, he had become a mere memory soon to be forgotten.
His shoulders slumped in defeat. Everyone has lost their hope, Trent realized. The truth tormented him: he had failed the kingdom, and because of his surrender, there would be no more heroes to carry on their flame of hope. It was extinguished. He wondered if he could ever be truly happy again.
He wished Karia’s knife had killed him after all.
As he reflected upon his years in the Rebellion, his thoughts no longer filled him with hope but dread. With a cruel twist, past warcries, mottos, and mantras tormented him, as their words—once motivational—now jeered him. Feeling his gut wrench deep inside of him, he mumbled a phrase he had once brazenly chanted so many times: “You are only defeated once you surrender your hope…”
We are defeated then, aren’t we?
Searching for relief, Trent met his sister’s eyes and once again found kindness kindled in them. He felt any hate inside of him flake away, crumbling to dust. In Sasha, Trent found the courage to push on for just a little bit longer, and to ask the hideous question that lurked deep inside of him. Like a clawing monster, it gnawed its way to the forefront of his mind, consuming all other thoughts. But this time, he didn’t push the question away—he confronted it. “Where’s Karia?”
Skies, the question terrified him. His mouth dried.
The atmosphere shifted palpably at his question. It was as though an ominous cloud had descended upon them, casting shadowed veils over their faces, darkening their expressions with an unspoken dread. Sasha's fingers tightened around his hand, a gesture of solace in the face of the unspeakable. Her eyes, brimming with unshed tears, were pools of sorrow.
Trent felt as though his own pulse had gone quiet. The silence was deafening, their avoidance a cacophony of alarm bells in his mind. Why aren’t they saying anything? The question seared through him, a wildfire of panic. He struggled to swallow the lump forming in his throat, the possibility he dreaded most surfacing like a specter in his thoughts. Had they killed her? The mere thought was a blade twisting in his gut, an unbearable notion that threatened to overwhelm him. Skies, I shouldn’t have asked the question! 
His family, just like him, had woven Karia into the very fabric of their lives. She was more than just Trent's second-in-command; she was a fixture in their collective heart. The void her absence left was palpable, a silent ache that resonated within each of them. They had all secretly harbored hopes of welcoming her into their fold, not just as a friend, but as family. Yet, that dream had been cruelly snatched away, leaving a void where once there was the promise of unity and warmth.
Selean, always bold and impulsive, set her jaw, turned and glared at Icar. “We don’t know because this idiot won’t tell us,” Selean spat, her defiance testament of the depth of her love for Karia.
Trent's eyes narrowed, his focus shifting to the king. He scrutinized Icar, searching for a crack in the monarch's facade, a glimpse into the thoughts behind that inscrutable expression. The quiet that stretched between them was thick with unvoiced questions and accusations. It was clear now why his family had been reticent; they were waiting, just as he was, for the tyrant to break his silence.
King Icar’s response was nothing more than a smirk, a simple curve of his lips. It was a look that mocked their pain, a silent, scornful dismissal of their concern. That smirk was a clear message: he held the cards, he controlled the game.
Trent was the one to fold. Anger boiled within him as the temperature rose. “Did you kill her?” he snarled, through gritted teeth. All eyes in the room turned to the King. It would have made any other person uncomfortable, but the monarch stepped into it, his chin held high. 
Calmly, the king folded his arms, his answer shocking. “I understand how you all see me as the villain—your greatest enemy,” he gave a wide grin. Trent wished he could punch those teeth in: the tyrant is my greatest enemy. 
Icar continued. “And I may be, but I am not evil. No, I didn’t kill your girlfriend,” he mocked. “I saved her.”
Not letting the surprise catch him off guard, Trent’s response was quick-witted. “Explain,” he demanded, his voice a low growl. The sardonic edge to Icar’s words reminded Trent of the enigma of the Trials: no one knew what went on there, but everyone knew that no one ever returned. Could he have taken Karia to the Trials? A shiver ran down his spine.
Icar signaled to his guards with a dismissive gesture, his expression inscrutable. "Take his family to their room, and leave us," he ordered. "I have matters to discuss with Trent, in private."
Charged with unspoken questions and fears, the room crackled with tension as Selean stood her ground. As the guards advanced, Selean shoved one aside, quickly grabbing one of the bars separating her from Trent. “I won’t leave my brother,” she hissed. 
Trent felt a surge of pride for her sister. She is so brave… and stupid. The thought gave him a faint smile.
But King Icar was not amused. “Now,” he commanded, a sharp edge in his voice brooking no argument. A guard slapped Selean with callous disregard, roughly grabbing her arms and forcibly shoving them behind her back. 
The hair on Trent’s arms stood up: no one treated his sisters like that. No one treated Selean like that. “Treat my family with respect!” He yelled, shaking with emotion, nearly breaching insanity. To the depths with the king!
King Icar eyed the guard, waiting to see his response. When the soldier did not comply with Trent’s plea, Icar smirked. The blasted fool knows he has all the control. Instinctively, Trent reached for his sword, but his hand brushed air. 
Yet, surprisingly, Icar sided with Trent. “Do as he requests; we are not barbarians,” the King reprimanded.
“Apologies, my King,” the guard said, yet under his breath, he grumbled, “These scum don’t deserve respect.”
        Once again, the King shocked Trent. “I do not want to hear you speak again today, Guard. You would learn well to appreciate the strength of your enemies. Now go.”
One by one, Trent’s family left the room, as no one dared to say anything that could snap the palpable tension in the room. On her way out, Trent’s mother squeezed his shoulder passionately. “We will see each other again. I promise.”
“We will,” Trent confirmed, quivering with determination. “Nothing will stand between us.” He would make sure of it. He had to.
With a soft puff, the door shut behind the guards and his family, leaving the room feeling empty. Trent felt as though his heart had gone out the door with them. The moment with his family had been so fleeting, and he craved their calming reassurance again. Now, all he felt was a smoldering pile of regret and a growing fear. Where was Karia?
Bold like an arrow, Trent stared straight at Icar. “What do you mean you saved her?” He accused, his words filled with venom.
        “She is alive in prison and her wounds were treated,” the King stated matter-of-factly. Trent felt a sense of relief breathe into his soul, yet he refused to trust him… or believe him. Icar always had a deeper motivation. What was it this time?
Rubbing his chin, Icar paced in front of Trent’s cell. “With me, you will never have to worry about the safety and care of Karia or your family. Be assured that your family will be well: they will have the best rooms, the best food, the best security — everything that our kingdom has left to offer.”
Trent narrowed his eyes. What is it that he wants? 
Icar continued. “Just like you need me, I need you, Trent. I need you to help me save more than just your family. I need you to help me save the people of the Kingdom! So let us help each other, shall we?”
Glaring at the king, Trent disrespectfully sat down. Grimacing, his hands instinctively went to the bandages around his abdomen—the pain was still fresh. “There is nothing you can show me to prove that you are actually interested in saving my people. You won’t fool me with your lies.”
King Icar frowned. “You don’t understand. Rebels never do. You see yourself as so righteous, so virtuous, and so honorable as you claim to fight for a better future. That's not what others see. I see fraud. I see unfulfilled promises. I see unnecessary fighting, pain, war. Death. And all of it under the false banner of hope.”
Trent spat, disgusted. “If you would only lower your tithes we wouldn't have to fight. You suppress the people underneath your heel: they cannot survive like that! Don’t you dare tell me that you don’t see all the starving children in the streets. They would have money to buy food without your incessant tithes!”
“And we as a kingdom cannot survive without those tithes,” Icar snapped, veins popping. “How can you be blind enough not to see the truth? No one here lives in decadence! We are under threat by the Heti, and our only option is appraisal by giving them their demanded tribute. That is how we all survive, Trent. Not how you survive.” The king's rage, no longer veiled, filled the room with a palpable tension, matched only by the intensity in Trent's eyes.
“Then why do you eat three meals a day?” Trent countered. “No one else in this kingdom has that privilege.”
“The Darkened Dawn does,” Icar rebuffed sharply, his voice laced with irritation. “And you are quick to assume, you ingrate. Rarely do I have that privilege.”
Trent scoffed, disbelief etched on his face. “You’re a liar. Why don’t you just wipe out the Darkened Dawn?”
“They follow their own laws, and they have slipped outside of my grasp,” Icar fumed, his fists clenched in frustration. “That's precisely why I need you. I need a seasoned war leader like you to defeat them!”
        “No,” Trent answered firmly. “No, I won’t help you.” He had already betrayed the kingdom once, and heavens above, he wasn’t going to again. He would do this for Karia. He could do this for her. For the person who always stood by him. 
        Icar threw his hands up in the air, exasperated. “Why are you so blasted stubborn?” He shook his head, clenching the glow stone tighter in his palm and it cracked it his hands. His tone was a low growl like a lion. “The seas are losing their fish. Our fields are underproducing. And our enemies raise their tribute each year. Soon there will be no food, leaving us with no choice but to risk our lives to harvest seaweed.”
        “Then forgo your demonic Trials,” Trent roared. “Stop wasting all of our resources to kill our own people!” The room echoed as silence followed, giving the king’s words time to sink deep. He paused. Wait, who are they paying tribute too? The Heti?
        “What—” Trent started, but Icar cut him off.  “Those Trials are our future. They are our only way to beat the blasted Heti! How shortsighted you are not to understand!”
Trent stood, and brought his face inches away from the King’s. He could smell the mint on his breath. “Who are these blasted Heti?” he hissed.
Incensed, Icar’s grip tightened around the glow-stone until it shattered. The room was abruptly enveloped in an eerie darkness, amplifying the tension. His voice, now a venomous snarl, cut through the gloom. “Are you serious? Your single-minded crusade against my throne blinded you to the true state of our world. How can you be so wilfully ignorant?”
Trent's response came as a low, dangerous growl, his patience frayed to its limits. “Enough,” he declared, his voice echoing off the stone walls, filled with a mix of rage and desperation. “Take me back to my family.”
 “You help me, and I guarantee their safety. You don’t make any demands. Understand?” The threat weighed heavily on Trent.
Fuming, Trent took a deep breath. Then in a torrent of anger, he punched the stone, his breath falling in cascades of rage. His dark hair — matted with sweat — swept over his right eye as he glared at the tyrant. “If anything happens to my family, Icar, I will put a sword to your throat. Their safety better be guaranteed, heavens above.”
“Don’t be a fool, Trent,” King Icar reprimanded, having regained his composure. “We can both get what we want: your family can be safe, and I get your help. Easy.”
        “I saved your life!” Trent snarled, raw with emotion. 
        “And I saved your family’s lives,” Icar pointed out. “You owe their lives thrice over.”
“I hate you.”
        “I know.”
        Narrowing his eyes, Trent scowled at Icar. He waited, his breath heavy, almost daring the king to threaten him. Yet, the King’s frown remained steady, as the standoff drew out. Minutes passed in tense silence. Finally, Trent’s resistance crumbled. He hated the words he tentatively spoke next, but he had no other choice. Icar had backed him into a corner. “What would you have me do?” he whispered, defeated.
“Since you murdered my High Executioner, a position has unexpectedly opened,” Icar said, his grin wide and unsettling. “You will take his place.”
Trent felt as if the ground had vanished beneath him. This is not peace. He knew the whispered rumors: it was said that the High Executioner was the only one that could accompany the king to run the Trials. There was no position of greater secrecy, trust, and… brutality. Trent shivered, remembering how the High Executioner had licked his lips as they fought. He remembered looking into the High Executioner’s eyes and seeing only twisted darkness. The night of the rebellion, Trent hadn’t killed a man, but a monster. How could I ever become that?
Trent swallowed, feeling the weight of his decision. He was cornered, bound by his vow to safeguard his family. He would not, could not fail them. Not now, not ever. Heavens above.
Yet, thoughts of Karia swirled in his mind. She would vehemently oppose this. She would have found a way to break free and strangle the scheming tyrant. But how could I do that? Trent was shackled by circumstance, and Icar held the keys to his family's well-being. He bit his lip, a silent vow to endure, to persist. I have to. For my family. 
With a heavy heart, he uttered, “So be it.”
He would become the High Executioner.
