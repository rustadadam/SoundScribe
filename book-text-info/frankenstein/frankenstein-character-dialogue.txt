I: "“ the land of mist and snow , ”" "“ Here is our captain , and he will not allow you to perish on the open sea . ”" "“ Before I come on board your vessel , ”" "“ will you have the kindness to inform me whither you are bound ? ”" "“ To seek one who fled from me . ”" "“ And did the man whom you pursued travel in the same fashion ? ”" "“ Yes . ”" "“ Then I fancy we have seen him , for the day before we picked you up we saw some dogs drawing a sledge , with a man in it , across the ice . ”" "“ I have , doubtless , excited your curiosity , as well as that of these good people ; but you are too considerate to make inquiries . ”" "“ Certainly ; it would indeed be very impertinent and inhuman in me to trouble you with any inquisitiveness of mine . ”" "“ And yet you rescued me from a strange and perilous situation ; you have benevolently restored me to life . ”" "“ Unhappy man ! Do you share my madness ? Have you drunk also of the intoxicating draught ? Hear me ; let me reveal my tale , and you will dash the cup from your lips ! ”" "“ I agree with you , ”" "“ we are unfashioned creatures , but half made up , if one wiser , better , dearer than ourselves — such a friend ought to be — do not lend his aid to perfectionate our weak and faulty natures . I once had a friend , the most noble of human creatures , and am entitled , therefore , to judge respecting friendship . You have hope , and the world before you , and have no cause for despair . But I — I have lost everything and can not begin life anew . ”" "“ You may easily perceive , Captain Walton , that I have suffered great and unparalleled misfortunes . I had determined at one time that the memory of these evils should die with me , but you have won me to alter my determination . You seek for knowledge and wisdom , as I once did ; and I ardently hope that the gratification of your wishes may not be a serpent to sting you , as mine has been . I do not know that the relation of my disasters will be useful to you ; yet , when I reflect that you are pursuing the same course , exposing yourself to the same dangers which have rendered me what I am , I imagine that you may deduce an apt moral from my tale , one that may direct you if you succeed in your undertaking and console you in case of failure . Prepare to hear of occurrences which are usually deemed marvellous . Were we among the tamer scenes of nature I might fear to encounter your unbelief , perhaps your ridicule ; but many things will appear possible in these wild and mysterious regions which would provoke the laughter of those unacquainted with the ever - varied powers of nature ; nor can I doubt but that my tale conveys in its series internal evidence of the truth of the events of which it is composed . ”" "“ I thank you , ”" "“ for your sympathy , but it is useless ; my fate is nearly fulfilled . I wait but for one event , and then I shall repose in peace . I understand your feeling , ”" "“ but you are mistaken , my friend , if thus you will allow me to name you ; nothing can alter my destiny ; listen to my history , and you will perceive how irrevocably it is determined . ”" "“ I have a pretty present for my Victor — tomorrow he shall have it . ”" "“ Ah ! Cornelius Agrippa ! My dear Victor , do not waste your time upon this ; it is sad trash . ”" "“ Every minute , ”" "“ I know that while you are pleased with yourself you will think of us with affection , and we shall hear regularly from you . You must pardon me if I regard any interruption in your correspondence as a proof that your other duties are equally neglected . ”" "“ Very well , and very happy , only a little uneasy that they hear from you so seldom . By the by , I mean to lecture you a little upon their account myself . But , my dear Frankenstein , ”" "“ I did not before remark how very ill you appear ; so thin and pale ; you look as if you had been watching for several nights . ”" "“ You have guessed right ; I have lately been so deeply engaged in one occupation that I have not allowed myself sufficient rest , as you see ; but I hope , I sincerely hope , that all these employments are now at an end and that I am at length free . ”" "“ Do not ask me , ”" "“ _ he _ can tell . Oh , save me ! Save me ! ”" "“ Dearest Clerval , ”" "“ how kind , how very good you are to me . This whole winter , instead of being spent in study , as you promised yourself , has been consumed in my sick room . How shall I ever repay you ? I feel the greatest remorse for the disappointment of which I have been the occasion , but you will forgive me . ”" "“ You will repay me entirely if you do not discompose yourself , but get well as fast as you can ; and since you appear in such good spirits , I may speak to you on one subject , may I not ? ”" "“ Compose yourself , ”" "“ I will not mention it if it agitates you ; but your father and cousin would be very happy if they received a letter from you in your own handwriting . They hardly know how ill you have been and are uneasy at your long silence . ”" "“ If this is your present temper , my friend , you will perhaps be glad to see a letter that has been lying here some days for you ; it is from your cousin , I believe . ”" "“ I have written myself into better spirits , dear cousin ; but my anxiety returns upon me as I conclude . Write , dearest Victor,—one line — one word will be a blessing to us . Ten thousand thanks to Henry for his kindness , his affection , and his many letters ; we are sincerely grateful . Adieu ! my cousin ; take care of yourself ; and , I entreat you , write !" "“ Elizabeth Lavenza ." "“ Geneva , March 18th , 17—. ”" "“ Dear , dear Elizabeth ! ”" "“ I will write instantly and relieve them from the anxiety they must feel . ”" "“ the palaces of nature , ”" "“ Dear mountains ! my own beautiful lake ! how do you welcome your wanderer ? Your summits are clear ; the sky and lake are blue and placid . Is this to prognosticate peace , or to mock at my unhappiness ? ”" "“ William , dear angel ! this is thy funeral , this thy dirge ! ”" "“ The murderer discovered ! Good God ! how can that be ? who could attempt to pursue him ? It is impossible ; one might as well try to overtake the winds , or confine a mountain - stream with a straw . I saw him too ; he was free last night ! ”" "“ I do not know what you mean , ”" "“ but to us the discovery we have made completes our misery . No one would believe it at first ; and even now Elizabeth will not be convinced , notwithstanding all the evidence . Indeed , who would credit that Justine Moritz , who was so amiable , and fond of all the family , could suddenly become so capable of so frightful , so appalling a crime ? ”" "“ No one did at first ; but several circumstances came out , that have almost forced conviction upon us ; and her own behaviour has been so confused , as to add to the evidence of facts a weight that , I fear , leaves no hope for doubt . But she will be tried today , and you will then hear all . ”" "“ You are all mistaken ; I know the murderer . Justine , poor , good Justine , is innocent . ”" "“ We do also , unfortunately , ”" "“ for indeed I had rather have been for ever ignorant than have discovered so much depravity and ungratitude in one I valued so highly . ”" "“ If she is , God forbid that she should suffer as guilty . She is to be tried today , and I hope , I sincerely hope , that she will be acquitted . ”" "“ She is innocent , my Elizabeth , ”" "“ and that shall be proved ; fear nothing , but let your spirits be cheered by the assurance of her acquittal . ”" "“ How kind and generous you are ! every one else believes in her guilt , and that made me wretched , for I knew that it was impossible : and to see every one else prejudiced in so deadly a manner rendered me hopeless and despairing . ”" "“ Dearest niece , ”" "“ dry your tears . If she is , as you believe , innocent , rely on the justice of our laws , and the activity with which I shall prevent the slightest shadow of partiality . ”" "“ I know , ”" "“ how heavily and fatally this one circumstance weighs against me , but I have no power of explaining it ; and when I have expressed my utter ignorance , I am only left to conjecture concerning the probabilities by which it might have been placed in my pocket . But here also I am checked . I believe that I have no enemy on earth , and none surely would have been so wicked as to destroy me wantonly . Did the murderer place it there ? I know of no opportunity afforded him for so doing ; or , if I had , why should he have stolen the jewel , to part with it again so soon ?" "“ I commit my cause to the justice of my judges , yet I see no room for hope . I beg permission to have a few witnesses examined concerning my character , and if their testimony shall not overweigh my supposed guilt , I must be condemned , although I would pledge my salvation on my innocence . ”" "“ That evidence , ”" "“ was hardly required in so glaring a case , but I am glad of it , and , indeed , none of our judges like to condemn a criminal upon circumstantial evidence , be it ever so decisive . ”" "“ My cousin , ”" "“ it is decided as you may have expected ; all judges had rather that ten innocent should suffer than that one guilty should escape . But she has confessed . ”" "“ I thought with horror , my sweet lady , that you should believe your Justine , whom your blessed aunt had so highly honoured , and whom you loved , was a creature capable of a crime which none but the devil himself could have perpetrated . Dear William ! dearest blessed child ! I soon shall see you again in heaven , where we shall all be happy ; and that consoles me , going as I am to suffer ignominy and death . ”" "“ Do you think , Victor , ”" "“ that I do not suffer also ? No one could love a child more than I loved your brother”—tears" "spoke—“but is it not a duty to the survivors that we should refrain from augmenting their unhappiness by an appearance of immoderate grief ? It is also a duty owed to yourself , for excessive sorrow prevents improvement or enjoyment , or even the discharge of daily usefulness , without which no man is fit for society . ”" "“ Wandering spirits , if indeed ye wander , and do not rest in your narrow beds , allow me this faint happiness , or take me , as your companion , away from the joys of life . ”" "“ Devil , ”" "“ do you dare approach me ? And do not you fear the fierce vengeance of my arm wreaked on your miserable head ? Begone , vile insect ! Or rather , stay , that I may trample you to dust ! And , oh ! That I could , with the extinction of your miserable existence , restore those victims whom you have so diabolically murdered ! ”" "“ I expected this reception , ”" "“ All men hate the wretched ; how , then , must I be hated , who am miserable beyond all living things ! Yet you , my creator , detest and spurn me , thy creature , to whom thou art bound by ties only dissoluble by the annihilation of one of us . You purpose to kill me . How dare you sport thus with life ? Do your duty towards me , and I will do mine towards you and the rest of mankind . If you will comply with my conditions , I will leave them and you at peace ; but if you refuse , I will glut the maw of death , until it be satiated with the blood of your remaining friends . ”" "“ Abhorred monster ! Fiend that thou art ! The tortures of hell are too mild a vengeance for thy crimes . Wretched devil ! You reproach me with your creation , come on , then , that I may extinguish the spark which I so negligently bestowed . ”" "“ Be calm ! I entreat you to hear me before you give vent to your hatred on my devoted head . Have I not suffered enough , that you seek to increase my misery ? Life , although it may only be an accumulation of anguish , is dear to me , and I will defend it . Remember , thou hast made me more powerful than thyself ; my height is superior to thine , my joints more supple . But I will not be tempted to set myself in opposition to thee . I am thy creature , and I will be even mild and docile to my natural lord and king if thou wilt also perform thy part , the which thou owest me . Oh , Frankenstein , be not equitable to every other and trample upon me alone , to whom thy justice , and even thy clemency and affection , is most due . Remember that I am thy creature ; I ought to be thy Adam , but I am rather the fallen angel , whom thou drivest from joy for no misdeed . Everywhere I see bliss , from which I alone am irrevocably excluded . I was benevolent and good ; misery made me a fiend . Make me happy , and I shall again be virtuous . ”" "“ Begone ! I will not hear you . There can be no community between you and me ; we are enemies . Begone , or let us try our strength in a fight , in which one must fall . ”" "“ How can I move thee ? Will no entreaties cause thee to turn a favourable eye upon thy creature , who implores thy goodness and compassion ? Believe me , Frankenstein , I was benevolent ; my soul glowed with love and humanity ; but am I not alone , miserably alone ? You , my creator , abhor me ; what hope can I gather from your fellow creatures , who owe me nothing ? They spurn and hate me . The desert mountains and dreary glaciers are my refuge . I have wandered here many days ; the caves of ice , which I only do not fear , are a dwelling to me , and the only one which man does not grudge . These bleak skies I hail , for they are kinder to me than your fellow beings . If the multitude of mankind knew of my existence , they would do as you do , and arm themselves for my destruction . Shall I not then hate them who abhor me ? I will keep no terms with my enemies . I am miserable , and they shall share my wretchedness . Yet it is in your power to recompense me , and deliver them from an evil which it only remains for you to make so great , that not only you and your family , but thousands of others , shall be swallowed up in the whirlwinds of its rage . Let your compassion be moved , and do not disdain me . Listen to my tale ; when you have heard that , abandon or commiserate me , as you shall judge that I deserve . But hear me . The guilty are allowed , by human laws , bloody as they are , to speak in their own defence before they are condemned . Listen to me , Frankenstein . You accuse me of murder , and yet you would , with a satisfied conscience , destroy your own creature . Oh , praise the eternal justice of man ! Yet I ask you not to spare me ; listen to me , and then , if you can , and if you will , destroy the work of your hands . ”" "“ Why do you call to my remembrance , ”" "“ circumstances of which I shudder to reflect , that I have been the miserable origin and author ? Cursed be the day , abhorred devil , in which you first saw light ! Cursed ( although I curse myself ) be the hands that formed you ! You have made me wretched beyond expression . You have left me no power to consider whether I am just to you or not . Begone ! Relieve me from the sight of your detested form . ”" "“ Thus I relieve thee , my creator , ”" "“ thus I take from thee a sight which you abhor . Still thou canst listen to me and grant me thy compassion . By the virtues that I once possessed , I demand this from you . Hear my tale ; it is long and strange , and the temperature of this place is not fitting to your fine sensations ; come to the hut upon the mountain . The sun is yet high in the heavens ; before it descends to hide itself behind your snowy precipices and illuminate another world , you will have heard my story and can decide . On you it rests , whether I quit for ever the neighbourhood of man and lead a harmless life , or become the scourge of your fellow creatures and the author of your own speedy ruin . ”" "“ It is with considerable difficulty that I remember the original era of my being ; all the events of that period appear confused and indistinct . A strange multiplicity of sensations seized me , and I saw , felt , heard , and smelt at the same time ; and it was , indeed , a long time before I learned to distinguish between the operations of my various senses . By degrees , I remember , a stronger light pressed upon my nerves , so that I was obliged to shut my eyes . Darkness then came over me and troubled me , but hardly had I felt this when , by opening my eyes , as I now suppose , the light poured in upon me again . I walked and , I believe , descended , but I presently found a great alteration in my sensations . Before , dark and opaque bodies had surrounded me , impervious to my touch or sight ; but I now found that I could wander on at liberty , with no obstacles which I could not either surmount or avoid . The light became more and more oppressive to me , and the heat wearying me as I walked , I sought a place where I could receive shade . This was the forest near Ingolstadt ; and here I lay by the side of a brook resting from my fatigue , until I felt tormented by hunger and thirst . This roused me from my nearly dormant state , and I ate some berries which I found hanging on the trees or lying on the ground . I slaked my thirst at the brook , and then lying down , was overcome by sleep ." "“ It was dark when I awoke ; I felt cold also , and half frightened , as it were , instinctively , finding myself so desolate . Before I had quitted your apartment , on a sensation of cold , I had covered myself with some clothes , but these were insufficient to secure me from the dews of night . I was a poor , helpless , miserable wretch ; I knew , and could distinguish , nothing ; but feeling pain invade me on all sides , I sat down and wept ." "“ Soon a gentle light stole over the heavens and gave me a sensation of pleasure . I started up and beheld a radiant form rise from among the trees . [ The moon ] I gazed with a kind of wonder . It moved slowly , but it enlightened my path , and I again went out in search of berries . I was still cold when under one of the trees I found a huge cloak , with which I covered myself , and sat down upon the ground . No distinct ideas occupied my mind ; all was confused . I felt light , and hunger , and thirst , and darkness ; innumerable sounds rang in my ears , and on all sides various scents saluted me ; the only object that I could distinguish was the bright moon , and I fixed my eyes on that with pleasure ." "“ Several changes of day and night passed , and the orb of night had greatly lessened , when I began to distinguish my sensations from each other . I gradually saw plainly the clear stream that supplied me with drink and the trees that shaded me with their foliage . I was delighted when I first discovered that a pleasant sound , which often saluted my ears , proceeded from the throats of the little winged animals who had often intercepted the light from my eyes . I began also to observe , with greater accuracy , the forms that surrounded me and to perceive the boundaries of the radiant roof of light which canopied me . Sometimes I tried to imitate the pleasant songs of the birds but was unable . Sometimes I wished to express my sensations in my own mode , but the uncouth and inarticulate sounds which broke from me frightened me into silence again ." "“ The moon had disappeared from the night , and again , with a lessened form , showed itself , while I still remained in the forest . My sensations had by this time become distinct , and my mind received every day additional ideas . My eyes became accustomed to the light and to perceive objects in their right forms ; I distinguished the insect from the herb , and by degrees , one herb from another . I found that the sparrow uttered none but harsh notes , whilst those of the blackbird and thrush were sweet and enticing ." "“ One day , when I was oppressed by cold , I found a fire which had been left by some wandering beggars , and was overcome with delight at the warmth I experienced from it . In my joy I thrust my hand into the live embers , but quickly drew it out again with a cry of pain . How strange , I thought , that the same cause should produce such opposite effects ! I examined the materials of the fire , and to my joy found it to be composed of wood . I quickly collected some branches , but they were wet and would not burn . I was pained at this and sat still watching the operation of the fire . The wet wood which I had placed near the heat dried and itself became inflamed . I reflected on this , and by touching the various branches , I discovered the cause and busied myself in collecting a great quantity of wood , that I might dry it and have a plentiful supply of fire . When night came on and brought sleep with it , I was in the greatest fear lest my fire should be extinguished . I covered it carefully with dry wood and leaves and placed wet branches upon it ; and then , spreading my cloak , I lay on the ground and sank into sleep ." "“ It was morning when I awoke , and my first care was to visit the fire . I uncovered it , and a gentle breeze quickly fanned it into a flame . I observed this also and contrived a fan of branches , which roused the embers when they were nearly extinguished . When night came again I found , with pleasure , that the fire gave light as well as heat and that the discovery of this element was useful to me in my food , for I found some of the offals that the travellers had left had been roasted , and tasted much more savoury than the berries I gathered from the trees . I tried , therefore , to dress my food in the same manner , placing it on the live embers . I found that the berries were spoiled by this operation , and the nuts and roots much improved ." "“ Food , however , became scarce , and I often spent the whole day searching in vain for a few acorns to assuage the pangs of hunger . When I found this , I resolved to quit the place that I had hitherto inhabited , to seek for one where the few wants I experienced would be more easily satisfied . In this emigration I exceedingly lamented the loss of the fire which I had obtained through accident and knew not how to reproduce it . I gave several hours to the serious consideration of this difficulty , but I was obliged to relinquish all attempt to supply it , and wrapping myself up in my cloak , I struck across the wood towards the setting sun . I passed three days in these rambles and at length discovered the open country . A great fall of snow had taken place the night before , and the fields were of one uniform white ; the appearance was disconsolate , and I found my feet chilled by the cold damp substance that covered the ground ." "“ It was about seven in the morning , and I longed to obtain food and shelter ; at length I perceived a small hut , on a rising ground , which had doubtless been built for the convenience of some shepherd . This was a new sight to me , and I examined the structure with great curiosity . Finding the door open , I entered . An old man sat in it , near a fire , over which he was preparing his breakfast . He turned on hearing a noise , and perceiving me , shrieked loudly , and quitting the hut , ran across the fields with a speed of which his debilitated form hardly appeared capable . His appearance , different from any I had ever before seen , and his flight somewhat surprised me . But I was enchanted by the appearance of the hut ; here the snow and rain could not penetrate ; the ground was dry ; and it presented to me then as exquisite and divine a retreat as Pandæmonium appeared to the dæmons of hell after their sufferings in the lake of fire . I greedily devoured the remnants of the shepherd ’s breakfast , which consisted of bread , cheese , milk , and wine ; the latter , however , I did not like . Then , overcome by fatigue , I lay down among some straw and fell asleep ." "“ It was noon when I awoke , and allured by the warmth of the sun , which shone brightly on the white ground , I determined to recommence my travels ; and , depositing the remains of the peasant ’s breakfast in a wallet I found , I proceeded across the fields for several hours , until at sunset I arrived at a village . How miraculous did this appear ! The huts , the neater cottages , and stately houses engaged my admiration by turns . The vegetables in the gardens , the milk and cheese that I saw placed at the windows of some of the cottages , allured my appetite . One of the best of these I entered , but I had hardly placed my foot within the door before the children shrieked , and one of the women fainted . The whole village was roused ; some fled , some attacked me , until , grievously bruised by stones and many other kinds of missile weapons , I escaped to the open country and fearfully took refuge in a low hovel , quite bare , and making a wretched appearance after the palaces I had beheld in the village . This hovel however , joined a cottage of a neat and pleasant appearance , but after my late dearly bought experience , I dared not enter it . My place of refuge was constructed of wood , but so low that I could with difficulty sit upright in it . No wood , however , was placed on the earth , which formed the floor , but it was dry ; and although the wind entered it by innumerable chinks , I found it an agreeable asylum from the snow and rain ." "“ Here , then , I retreated and lay down happy to have found a shelter , however miserable , from the inclemency of the season , and still more from the barbarity of man . As soon as morning dawned I crept from my kennel , that I might view the adjacent cottage and discover if I could remain in the habitation I had found . It was situated against the back of the cottage and surrounded on the sides which were exposed by a pig sty and a clear pool of water . One part was open , and by that I had crept in ; but now I covered every crevice by which I might be perceived with stones and wood , yet in such a manner that I might move them on occasion to pass out ; all the light I enjoyed came through the sty , and that was sufficient for me ." "“ Having thus arranged my dwelling and carpeted it with clean straw , I retired , for I saw the figure of a man at a distance , and I remembered too well my treatment the night before to trust myself in his power . I had first , however , provided for my sustenance for that day by a loaf of coarse bread , which I purloined , and a cup with which I could drink more conveniently than from my hand of the pure water which flowed by my retreat . The floor was a little raised , so that it was kept perfectly dry , and by its vicinity to the chimney of the cottage it was tolerably warm ." "“ Being thus provided , I resolved to reside in this hovel until something should occur which might alter my determination . It was indeed a paradise compared to the bleak forest , my former residence , the rain - dropping branches , and dank earth . I ate my breakfast with pleasure and was about to remove a plank to procure myself a little water when I heard a step , and looking through a small chink , I beheld a young creature , with a pail on her head , passing before my hovel . The girl was young and of gentle demeanour , unlike what I have since found cottagers and farmhouse servants to be . Yet she was meanly dressed , a coarse blue petticoat and a linen jacket being her only garb ; her fair hair was plaited but not adorned : she looked patient yet sad . I lost sight of her , and in about a quarter of an hour she returned bearing the pail , which was now partly filled with milk . As she walked along , seemingly incommoded by the burden , a young man met her , whose countenance expressed a deeper despondence . Uttering a few sounds with an air of melancholy , he took the pail from her head and bore it to the cottage himself . She followed , and they disappeared . Presently I saw the young man again , with some tools in his hand , cross the field behind the cottage ; and the girl was also busied , sometimes in the house and sometimes in the yard ." "“ On examining my dwelling , I found that one of the windows of the cottage had formerly occupied a part of it , but the panes had been filled up with wood . In one of these was a small and almost imperceptible chink through which the eye could just penetrate . Through this crevice a small room was visible , whitewashed and clean but very bare of furniture . In one corner , near a small fire , sat an old man , leaning his head on his hands in a disconsolate attitude . The young girl was occupied in arranging the cottage ; but presently she took something out of a drawer , which employed her hands , and she sat down beside the old man , who , taking up an instrument , began to play and to produce sounds sweeter than the voice of the thrush or the nightingale . It was a lovely sight , even to me , poor wretch who had never beheld aught beautiful before . The silver hair and benevolent countenance of the aged cottager won my reverence , while the gentle manners of the girl enticed my love . He played a sweet mournful air which I perceived drew tears from the eyes of his amiable companion , of which the old man took no notice , until she sobbed audibly ; he then pronounced a few sounds , and the fair creature , leaving her work , knelt at his feet . He raised her and smiled with such kindness and affection that I felt sensations of a peculiar and overpowering nature ; they were a mixture of pain and pleasure , such as I had never before experienced , either from hunger or cold , warmth or food ; and I withdrew from the window , unable to bear these emotions ." "“ Soon after this the young man returned , bearing on his shoulders a load of wood . The girl met him at the door , helped to relieve him of his burden , and taking some of the fuel into the cottage , placed it on the fire ; then she and the youth went apart into a nook of the cottage , and he showed her a large loaf and a piece of cheese . She seemed pleased and went into the garden for some roots and plants , which she placed in water , and then upon the fire . She afterwards continued her work , whilst the young man went into the garden and appeared busily employed in digging and pulling up roots . After he had been employed thus about an hour , the young woman joined him and they entered the cottage together ." "“ The old man had , in the meantime , been pensive , but on the appearance of his companions he assumed a more cheerful air , and they sat down to eat . The meal was quickly dispatched . The young woman was again occupied in arranging the cottage , the old man walked before the cottage in the sun for a few minutes , leaning on the arm of the youth . Nothing could exceed in beauty the contrast between these two excellent creatures . One was old , with silver hairs and a countenance beaming with benevolence and love ; the younger was slight and graceful in his figure , and his features were moulded with the finest symmetry , yet his eyes and attitude expressed the utmost sadness and despondency . The old man returned to the cottage , and the youth , with tools different from those he had used in the morning , directed his steps across the fields ." "“ Night quickly shut in , but to my extreme wonder , I found that the cottagers had a means of prolonging light by the use of tapers , and was delighted to find that the setting of the sun did not put an end to the pleasure I experienced in watching my human neighbours . In the evening the young girl and her companion were employed in various occupations which I did not understand ; and the old man again took up the instrument which produced the divine sounds that had enchanted me in the morning . So soon as he had finished , the youth began , not to play , but to utter sounds that were monotonous , and neither resembling the harmony of the old man ’s instrument nor the songs of the birds ; I since found that he read aloud , but at that time I knew nothing of the science of words or letters ." "“ The family , after having been thus occupied for a short time , extinguished their lights and retired , as I conjectured , to rest . ”" "“ I lay on my straw , but I could not sleep . I thought of the occurrences of the day . What chiefly struck me was the gentle manners of these people , and I longed to join them , but dared not . I remembered too well the treatment I had suffered the night before from the barbarous villagers , and resolved , whatever course of conduct I might hereafter think it right to pursue , that for the present I would remain quietly in my hovel , watching and endeavouring to discover the motives which influenced their actions ." "“ The cottagers arose the next morning before the sun . The young woman arranged the cottage and prepared the food , and the youth departed after the first meal ." "“ This day was passed in the same routine as that which preceded it . The young man was constantly employed out of doors , and the girl in various laborious occupations within . The old man , whom I soon perceived to be blind , employed his leisure hours on his instrument or in contemplation . Nothing could exceed the love and respect which the younger cottagers exhibited towards their venerable companion . They performed towards him every little office of affection and duty with gentleness , and he rewarded them by his benevolent smiles ." "“ They were not entirely happy . The young man and his companion often went apart and appeared to weep . I saw no cause for their unhappiness , but I was deeply affected by it . If such lovely creatures were miserable , it was less strange that I , an imperfect and solitary being , should be wretched . Yet why were these gentle beings unhappy ? They possessed a delightful house ( for such it was in my eyes ) and every luxury ; they had a fire to warm them when chill and delicious viands when hungry ; they were dressed in excellent clothes ; and , still more , they enjoyed one another ’s company and speech , interchanging each day looks of affection and kindness . What did their tears imply ? Did they really express pain ? I was at first unable to solve these questions , but perpetual attention and time explained to me many appearances which were at first enigmatic ." "“ A considerable period elapsed before I discovered one of the causes of the uneasiness of this amiable family : it was poverty , and they suffered that evil in a very distressing degree . Their nourishment consisted entirely of the vegetables of their garden and the milk of one cow , which gave very little during the winter , when its masters could scarcely procure food to support it . They often , I believe , suffered the pangs of hunger very poignantly , especially the two younger cottagers , for several times they placed food before the old man when they reserved none for themselves ." "“ This trait of kindness moved me sensibly . I had been accustomed , during the night , to steal a part of their store for my own consumption , but when I found that in doing this I inflicted pain on the cottagers , I abstained and satisfied myself with berries , nuts , and roots which I gathered from a neighbouring wood ." "“ I discovered also another means through which I was enabled to assist their labours . I found that the youth spent a great part of each day in collecting wood for the family fire , and during the night I often took his tools , the use of which I quickly discovered , and brought home firing sufficient for the consumption of several days ." "“ I remember , the first time that I did this , the young woman , when she opened the door in the morning , appeared greatly astonished on seeing a great pile of wood on the outside . She uttered some words in a loud voice , and the youth joined her , who also expressed surprise . I observed , with pleasure , that he did not go to the forest that day , but spent it in repairing the cottage and cultivating the garden ." "“ By degrees I made a discovery of still greater moment . I found that these people possessed a method of communicating their experience and feelings to one another by articulate sounds . I perceived that the words they spoke sometimes produced pleasure or pain , smiles or sadness , in the minds and countenances of the hearers . This was indeed a godlike science , and I ardently desired to become acquainted with it . But I was baffled in every attempt I made for this purpose . Their pronunciation was quick , and the words they uttered , not having any apparent connection with visible objects , I was unable to discover any clue by which I could unravel the mystery of their reference . By great application , however , and after having remained during the space of several revolutions of the moon in my hovel , I discovered the names that were given to some of the most familiar objects of discourse ; I learned and applied the words , _ fire , milk , bread , _ and _ wood . _ I learned also the names of the cottagers themselves . The youth and his companion had each of them several names , but the old man had only one , which was _ father . _ The girl was called _ sister _ or _ Agatha , _ and the youth _ Felix , brother , _ or _ son _ . I can not describe the delight I felt when I learned the ideas appropriated to each of these sounds and was able to pronounce them . I distinguished several other words without being able as yet to understand or apply them , such as _ good , dearest , unhappy . _" "“ I spent the winter in this manner . The gentle manners and beauty of the cottagers greatly endeared them to me ; when they were unhappy , I felt depressed ; when they rejoiced , I sympathised in their joys . I saw few human beings besides them , and if any other happened to enter the cottage , their harsh manners and rude gait only enhanced to me the superior accomplishments of my friends . The old man , I could perceive , often endeavoured to encourage his children , as sometimes I found that he called them , to cast off their melancholy . He would talk in a cheerful accent , with an expression of goodness that bestowed pleasure even upon me . Agatha listened with respect , her eyes sometimes filled with tears , which she endeavoured to wipe away unperceived ; but I generally found that her countenance and tone were more cheerful after having listened to the exhortations of her father . It was not thus with Felix . He was always the saddest of the group , and even to my unpractised senses , he appeared to have suffered more deeply than his friends . But if his countenance was more sorrowful , his voice was more cheerful than that of his sister , especially when he addressed the old man ." "“ I could mention innumerable instances which , although slight , marked the dispositions of these amiable cottagers . In the midst of poverty and want , Felix carried with pleasure to his sister the first little white flower that peeped out from beneath the snowy ground . Early in the morning , before she had risen , he cleared away the snow that obstructed her path to the milk - house , drew water from the well , and brought the wood from the outhouse , where , to his perpetual astonishment , he found his store always replenished by an invisible hand . In the day , I believe , he worked sometimes for a neighbouring farmer , because he often went forth and did not return until dinner , yet brought no wood with him . At other times he worked in the garden , but as there was little to do in the frosty season , he read to the old man and Agatha ." "“ This reading had puzzled me extremely at first , but by degrees I discovered that he uttered many of the same sounds when he read as when he talked . I conjectured , therefore , that he found on the paper signs for speech which he understood , and I ardently longed to comprehend these also ; but how was that possible when I did not even understand the sounds for which they stood as signs ? I improved , however , sensibly in this science , but not sufficiently to follow up any kind of conversation , although I applied my whole mind to the endeavour , for I easily perceived that , although I eagerly longed to discover myself to the cottagers , I ought not to make the attempt until I had first become master of their language , which knowledge might enable me to make them overlook the deformity of my figure , for with this also the contrast perpetually presented to my eyes had made me acquainted ." "“ I had admired the perfect forms of my cottagers — their grace , beauty , and delicate complexions ; but how was I terrified when I viewed myself in a transparent pool ! At first I started back , unable to believe that it was indeed I who was reflected in the mirror ; and when I became fully convinced that I was in reality the monster that I am , I was filled with the bitterest sensations of despondence and mortification . Alas ! I did not yet entirely know the fatal effects of this miserable deformity ." "“ As the sun became warmer and the light of day longer , the snow vanished , and I beheld the bare trees and the black earth . From this time Felix was more employed , and the heart - moving indications of impending famine disappeared . Their food , as I afterwards found , was coarse , but it was wholesome ; and they procured a sufficiency of it . Several new kinds of plants sprang up in the garden , which they dressed ; and these signs of comfort increased daily as the season advanced ." "“ The old man , leaning on his son , walked each day at noon , when it did not rain , as I found it was called when the heavens poured forth its waters . This frequently took place , but a high wind quickly dried the earth , and the season became far more pleasant than it had been ." "“ My mode of life in my hovel was uniform . During the morning I attended the motions of the cottagers , and when they were dispersed in various occupations , I slept ; the remainder of the day was spent in observing my friends . When they had retired to rest , if there was any moon or the night was star - light , I went into the woods and collected my own food and fuel for the cottage . When I returned , as often as it was necessary , I cleared their path from the snow and performed those offices that I had seen done by Felix . I afterwards found that these labours , performed by an invisible hand , greatly astonished them ; and once or twice I heard them , on these occasions , utter the words _ good spirit , wonderful _ ; but I did not then understand the signification of these terms ." "“ My thoughts now became more active , and I longed to discover the motives and feelings of these lovely creatures ; I was inquisitive to know why Felix appeared so miserable and Agatha so sad . I thought ( foolish wretch ! ) that it might be in my power to restore happiness to these deserving people . When I slept or was absent , the forms of the venerable blind father , the gentle Agatha , and the excellent Felix flitted before me . I looked upon them as superior beings who would be the arbiters of my future destiny . I formed in my imagination a thousand pictures of presenting myself to them , and their reception of me . I imagined that they would be disgusted , until , by my gentle demeanour and conciliating words , I should first win their favour and afterwards their love ." "“ These thoughts exhilarated me and led me to apply with fresh ardour to the acquiring the art of language . My organs were indeed harsh , but supple ; and although my voice was very unlike the soft music of their tones , yet I pronounced such words as I understood with tolerable ease . It was as the ass and the lap - dog ; yet surely the gentle ass whose intentions were affectionate , although his manners were rude , deserved better treatment than blows and execration ." "“ The pleasant showers and genial warmth of spring greatly altered the aspect of the earth . Men who before this change seemed to have been hid in caves dispersed themselves and were employed in various arts of cultivation . The birds sang in more cheerful notes , and the leaves began to bud forth on the trees . Happy , happy earth ! Fit habitation for gods , which , so short a time before , was bleak , damp , and unwholesome . My spirits were elevated by the enchanting appearance of nature ; the past was blotted from my memory , the present was tranquil , and the future gilded by bright rays of hope and anticipations of joy . ”" "“ I now hasten to the more moving part of my story . I shall relate events that impressed me with feelings which , from what I had been , have made me what I am ." "“ Spring advanced rapidly ; the weather became fine and the skies cloudless . It surprised me that what before was desert and gloomy should now bloom with the most beautiful flowers and verdure . My senses were gratified and refreshed by a thousand scents of delight and a thousand sights of beauty ." "“ It was on one of these days , when my cottagers periodically rested from labour — the old man played on his guitar , and the children listened to him — that I observed the countenance of Felix was melancholy beyond expression ; he sighed frequently , and once his father paused in his music , and I conjectured by his manner that he inquired the cause of his son ’s sorrow . Felix replied in a cheerful accent , and the old man was recommencing his music when someone tapped at the door ." "“ It was a lady on horseback , accompanied by a country - man as a guide . The lady was dressed in a dark suit and covered with a thick black veil . Agatha asked a question , to which the stranger only replied by pronouncing , in a sweet accent , the name of Felix . Her voice was musical but unlike that of either of my friends . On hearing this word , Felix came up hastily to the lady , who , when she saw him , threw up her veil , and I beheld a countenance of angelic beauty and expression . Her hair of a shining raven black , and curiously braided ; her eyes were dark , but gentle , although animated ; her features of a regular proportion , and her complexion wondrously fair , each cheek tinged with a lovely pink ." "“ Felix seemed ravished with delight when he saw her , every trait of sorrow vanished from his face , and it instantly expressed a degree of ecstatic joy , of which I could hardly have believed it capable ; his eyes sparkled , as his cheek flushed with pleasure ; and at that moment I thought him as beautiful as the stranger . She appeared affected by different feelings ; wiping a few tears from her lovely eyes , she held out her hand to Felix , who kissed it rapturously and called her , as well as I could distinguish , his sweet Arabian . She did not appear to understand him , but smiled . He assisted her to dismount , and dismissing her guide , conducted her into the cottage . Some conversation took place between him and his father , and the young stranger knelt at the old man ’s feet and would have kissed his hand , but he raised her and embraced her affectionately ." "“ I soon perceived that although the stranger uttered articulate sounds and appeared to have a language of her own , she was neither understood by nor herself understood the cottagers . They made many signs which I did not comprehend , but I saw that her presence diffused gladness through the cottage , dispelling their sorrow as the sun dissipates the morning mists . Felix seemed peculiarly happy and with smiles of delight welcomed his Arabian . Agatha , the ever - gentle Agatha , kissed the hands of the lovely stranger , and pointing to her brother , made signs which appeared to me to mean that he had been sorrowful until she came . Some hours passed thus , while they , by their countenances , expressed joy , the cause of which I did not comprehend . Presently I found , by the frequent recurrence of some sound which the stranger repeated after them , that she was endeavouring to learn their language ; and the idea instantly occurred to me that I should make use of the same instructions to the same end . The stranger learned about twenty words at the first lesson ; most of them , indeed , were those which I had before understood , but I profited by the others ." "“ As night came on , Agatha and the Arabian retired early . When they separated Felix kissed the hand of the stranger and said , ‘ Good night sweet Safie . ’ He sat up much longer , conversing with his father , and by the frequent repetition of her name I conjectured that their lovely guest was the subject of their conversation . I ardently desired to understand them , and bent every faculty towards that purpose , but found it utterly impossible ." "“ The next morning Felix went out to his work , and after the usual occupations of Agatha were finished , the Arabian sat at the feet of the old man , and taking his guitar , played some airs so entrancingly beautiful that they at once drew tears of sorrow and delight from my eyes . She sang , and her voice flowed in a rich cadence , swelling or dying away like a nightingale of the woods ." "“ When she had finished , she gave the guitar to Agatha , who at first declined it . She played a simple air , and her voice accompanied it in sweet accents , but unlike the wondrous strain of the stranger . The old man appeared enraptured and said some words which Agatha endeavoured to explain to Safie , and by which he appeared to wish to express that she bestowed on him the greatest delight by her music ." "“ The days now passed as peaceably as before , with the sole alteration that joy had taken place of sadness in the countenances of my friends . Safie was always gay and happy ; she and I improved rapidly in the knowledge of language , so that in two months I began to comprehend most of the words uttered by my protectors ." "“ In the meanwhile also the black ground was covered with herbage , and the green banks interspersed with innumerable flowers , sweet to the scent and the eyes , stars of pale radiance among the moonlight woods ; the sun became warmer , the nights clear and balmy ; and my nocturnal rambles were an extreme pleasure to me , although they were considerably shortened by the late setting and early rising of the sun , for I never ventured abroad during daylight , fearful of meeting with the same treatment I had formerly endured in the first village which I entered ." "“ My days were spent in close attention , that I might more speedily master the language ; and I may boast that I improved more rapidly than the Arabian , who understood very little and conversed in broken accents , whilst I comprehended and could imitate almost every word that was spoken ." "“ While I improved in speech , I also learned the science of letters as it was taught to the stranger , and this opened before me a wide field for wonder and delight ." "“ The book from which Felix instructed Safie was Volney ’s _ Ruins of Empires _ . I should not have understood the purport of this book had not Felix , in reading it , given very minute explanations . He had chosen this work , he said , because the declamatory style was framed in imitation of the Eastern authors . Through this work I obtained a cursory knowledge of history and a view of the several empires at present existing in the world ; it gave me an insight into the manners , governments , and religions of the different nations of the earth . I heard of the slothful Asiatics , of the stupendous genius and mental activity of the Grecians , of the wars and wonderful virtue of the early Romans — of their subsequent degenerating — of the decline of that mighty empire , of chivalry , Christianity , and kings . I heard of the discovery of the American hemisphere and wept with Safie over the hapless fate of its original inhabitants ." "“ These wonderful narrations inspired me with strange feelings . Was man , indeed , at once so powerful , so virtuous and magnificent , yet so vicious and base ? He appeared at one time a mere scion of the evil principle and at another as all that can be conceived of noble and godlike . To be a great and virtuous man appeared the highest honour that can befall a sensitive being ; to be base and vicious , as many on record have been , appeared the lowest degradation , a condition more abject than that of the blind mole or harmless worm . For a long time I could not conceive how one man could go forth to murder his fellow , or even why there were laws and governments ; but when I heard details of vice and bloodshed , my wonder ceased and I turned away with disgust and loathing ." "“ Every conversation of the cottagers now opened new wonders to me . While I listened to the instructions which Felix bestowed upon the Arabian , the strange system of human society was explained to me . I heard of the division of property , of immense wealth and squalid poverty , of rank , descent , and noble blood ." "“ The words induced me to turn towards myself . I learned that the possessions most esteemed by your fellow creatures were high and unsullied descent united with riches . A man might be respected with only one of these advantages , but without either he was considered , except in very rare instances , as a vagabond and a slave , doomed to waste his powers for the profits of the chosen few ! And what was I ? Of my creation and creator I was absolutely ignorant , but I knew that I possessed no money , no friends , no kind of property . I was , besides , endued with a figure hideously deformed and loathsome ; I was not even of the same nature as man . I was more agile than they and could subsist upon coarser diet ; I bore the extremes of heat and cold with less injury to my frame ; my stature far exceeded theirs . When I looked around I saw and heard of none like me . Was I , then , a monster , a blot upon the earth , from which all men fled and whom all men disowned ?" "“ I can not describe to you the agony that these reflections inflicted upon me ; I tried to dispel them , but sorrow only increased with knowledge . Oh , that I had for ever remained in my native wood , nor known nor felt beyond the sensations of hunger , thirst , and heat !" "“ Of what a strange nature is knowledge ! It clings to the mind when it has once seized on it like a lichen on the rock . I wished sometimes to shake off all thought and feeling , but I learned that there was but one means to overcome the sensation of pain , and that was death — a state which I feared yet did not understand . I admired virtue and good feelings and loved the gentle manners and amiable qualities of my cottagers , but I was shut out from intercourse with them , except through means which I obtained by stealth , when I was unseen and unknown , and which rather increased than satisfied the desire I had of becoming one among my fellows . The gentle words of Agatha and the animated smiles of the charming Arabian were not for me . The mild exhortations of the old man and the lively conversation of the loved Felix were not for me . Miserable , unhappy wretch !" "“ Other lessons were impressed upon me even more deeply . I heard of the difference of sexes , and the birth and growth of children , how the father doted on the smiles of the infant , and the lively sallies of the older child , how all the life and cares of the mother were wrapped up in the precious charge , how the mind of youth expanded and gained knowledge , of brother , sister , and all the various relationships which bind one human being to another in mutual bonds ." "“ But where were my friends and relations ? No father had watched my infant days , no mother had blessed me with smiles and caresses ; or if they had , all my past life was now a blot , a blind vacancy in which I distinguished nothing . From my earliest remembrance I had been as I then was in height and proportion . I had never yet seen a being resembling me or who claimed any intercourse with me . What was I ? The question again recurred , to be answered only with groans ." "“ I will soon explain to what these feelings tended , but allow me now to return to the cottagers , whose story excited in me such various feelings of indignation , delight , and wonder , but which all terminated in additional love and reverence for my protectors ( for so I loved , in an innocent , half - painful self - deceit , to call them ) . ”" "“ Some time elapsed before I learned the history of my friends . It was one which could not fail to impress itself deeply on my mind , unfolding as it did a number of circumstances , each interesting and wonderful to one so utterly inexperienced as I was ." "“ The name of the old man was De Lacey . He was descended from a good family in France , where he had lived for many years in affluence , respected by his superiors and beloved by his equals . His son was bred in the service of his country , and Agatha had ranked with ladies of the highest distinction . A few months before my arrival they had lived in a large and luxurious city called Paris , surrounded by friends and possessed of every enjoyment which virtue , refinement of intellect , or taste , accompanied by a moderate fortune , could afford ." "“ The father of Safie had been the cause of their ruin . He was a Turkish merchant and had inhabited Paris for many years , when , for some reason which I could not learn , he became obnoxious to the government . He was seized and cast into prison the very day that Safie arrived from Constantinople to join him . He was tried and condemned to death . The injustice of his sentence was very flagrant ; all Paris was indignant ; and it was judged that his religion and wealth rather than the crime alleged against him had been the cause of his condemnation ." "“ Felix had accidentally been present at the trial ; his horror and indignation were uncontrollable when he heard the decision of the court . He made , at that moment , a solemn vow to deliver him and then looked around for the means . After many fruitless attempts to gain admittance to the prison , he found a strongly grated window in an unguarded part of the building , which lighted the dungeon of the unfortunate Muhammadan , who , loaded with chains , waited in despair the execution of the barbarous sentence . Felix visited the grate at night and made known to the prisoner his intentions in his favour . The Turk , amazed and delighted , endeavoured to kindle the zeal of his deliverer by promises of reward and wealth . Felix rejected his offers with contempt , yet when he saw the lovely Safie , who was allowed to visit her father and who by her gestures expressed her lively gratitude , the youth could not help owning to his own mind that the captive possessed a treasure which would fully reward his toil and hazard ." "“ The Turk quickly perceived the impression that his daughter had made on the heart of Felix and endeavoured to secure him more entirely in his interests by the promise of her hand in marriage so soon as he should be conveyed to a place of safety . Felix was too delicate to accept this offer , yet he looked forward to the probability of the event as to the consummation of his happiness ." "“ During the ensuing days , while the preparations were going forward for the escape of the merchant , the zeal of Felix was warmed by several letters that he received from this lovely girl , who found means to express her thoughts in the language of her lover by the aid of an old man , a servant of her father who understood French . She thanked him in the most ardent terms for his intended services towards her parent , and at the same time she gently deplored her own fate ." "“ I have copies of these letters , for I found means , during my residence in the hovel , to procure the implements of writing ; and the letters were often in the hands of Felix or Agatha . Before I depart I will give them to you ; they will prove the truth of my tale ; but at present , as the sun is already far declined , I shall only have time to repeat the substance of them to you ." "“ Safie related that her mother was a Christian Arab , seized and made a slave by the Turks ; recommended by her beauty , she had won the heart of the father of Safie , who married her . The young girl spoke in high and enthusiastic terms of her mother , who , born in freedom , spurned the bondage to which she was now reduced . She instructed her daughter in the tenets of her religion and taught her to aspire to higher powers of intellect and an independence of spirit forbidden to the female followers of Muhammad . This lady died , but her lessons were indelibly impressed on the mind of Safie , who sickened at the prospect of again returning to Asia and being immured within the walls of a harem , allowed only to occupy herself with infantile amusements , ill - suited to the temper of her soul , now accustomed to grand ideas and a noble emulation for virtue . The prospect of marrying a Christian and remaining in a country where women were allowed to take a rank in society was enchanting to her ." "“ The day for the execution of the Turk was fixed , but on the night previous to it he quitted his prison and before morning was distant many leagues from Paris . Felix had procured passports in the name of his father , sister , and himself . He had previously communicated his plan to the former , who aided the deceit by quitting his house , under the pretence of a journey and concealed himself , with his daughter , in an obscure part of Paris ." "“ Felix conducted the fugitives through France to Lyons and across Mont Cenis to Leghorn , where the merchant had decided to wait a favourable opportunity of passing into some part of the Turkish dominions ." "“ Safie resolved to remain with her father until the moment of his departure , before which time the Turk renewed his promise that she should be united to his deliverer ; and Felix remained with them in expectation of that event ; and in the meantime he enjoyed the society of the Arabian , who exhibited towards him the simplest and tenderest affection . They conversed with one another through the means of an interpreter , and sometimes with the interpretation of looks ; and Safie sang to him the divine airs of her native country ." "“ The Turk allowed this intimacy to take place and encouraged the hopes of the youthful lovers , while in his heart he had formed far other plans . He loathed the idea that his daughter should be united to a Christian , but he feared the resentment of Felix if he should appear lukewarm , for he knew that he was still in the power of his deliverer if he should choose to betray him to the Italian state which they inhabited . He revolved a thousand plans by which he should be enabled to prolong the deceit until it might be no longer necessary , and secretly to take his daughter with him when he departed . His plans were facilitated by the news which arrived from Paris ." "“ The government of France were greatly enraged at the escape of their victim and spared no pains to detect and punish his deliverer . The plot of Felix was quickly discovered , and De Lacey and Agatha were thrown into prison . The news reached Felix and roused him from his dream of pleasure . His blind and aged father and his gentle sister lay in a noisome dungeon while he enjoyed the free air and the society of her whom he loved . This idea was torture to him . He quickly arranged with the Turk that if the latter should find a favourable opportunity for escape before Felix could return to Italy , Safie should remain as a boarder at a convent at Leghorn ; and then , quitting the lovely Arabian , he hastened to Paris and delivered himself up to the vengeance of the law , hoping to free De Lacey and Agatha by this proceeding ." "“ He did not succeed . They remained confined for five months before the trial took place , the result of which deprived them of their fortune and condemned them to a perpetual exile from their native country ." "“ They found a miserable asylum in the cottage in Germany , where I discovered them . Felix soon learned that the treacherous Turk , for whom he and his family endured such unheard - of oppression , on discovering that his deliverer was thus reduced to poverty and ruin , became a traitor to good feeling and honour and had quitted Italy with his daughter , insultingly sending Felix a pittance of money to aid him , as he said , in some plan of future maintenance ." "“ Such were the events that preyed on the heart of Felix and rendered him , when I first saw him , the most miserable of his family . He could have endured poverty , and while this distress had been the meed of his virtue , he gloried in it ; but the ingratitude of the Turk and the loss of his beloved Safie were misfortunes more bitter and irreparable . The arrival of the Arabian now infused new life into his soul ." "“ When the news reached Leghorn that Felix was deprived of his wealth and rank , the merchant commanded his daughter to think no more of her lover , but to prepare to return to her native country . The generous nature of Safie was outraged by this command ; she attempted to expostulate with her father , but he left her angrily , reiterating his tyrannical mandate ." "“ A few days after , the Turk entered his daughter ’s apartment and told her hastily that he had reason to believe that his residence at Leghorn had been divulged and that he should speedily be delivered up to the French government ; he had consequently hired a vessel to convey him to Constantinople , for which city he should sail in a few hours . He intended to leave his daughter under the care of a confidential servant , to follow at her leisure with the greater part of his property , which had not yet arrived at Leghorn ." "“ When alone , Safie resolved in her own mind the plan of conduct that it would become her to pursue in this emergency . A residence in Turkey was abhorrent to her ; her religion and her feelings were alike averse to it . By some papers of her father which fell into her hands she heard of the exile of her lover and learnt the name of the spot where he then resided . She hesitated some time , but at length she formed her determination . Taking with her some jewels that belonged to her and a sum of money , she quitted Italy with an attendant , a native of Leghorn , but who understood the common language of Turkey , and departed for Germany ." "“ She arrived in safety at a town about twenty leagues from the cottage of De Lacey , when her attendant fell dangerously ill . Safie nursed her with the most devoted affection , but the poor girl died , and the Arabian was left alone , unacquainted with the language of the country and utterly ignorant of the customs of the world . She fell , however , into good hands . The Italian had mentioned the name of the spot for which they were bound , and after her death the woman of the house in which they had lived took care that Safie should arrive in safety at the cottage of her lover . ”" "“ Such was the history of my beloved cottagers . It impressed me deeply . I learned , from the views of social life which it developed , to admire their virtues and to deprecate the vices of mankind ." "“ As yet I looked upon crime as a distant evil , benevolence and generosity were ever present before me , inciting within me a desire to become an actor in the busy scene where so many admirable qualities were called forth and displayed . But in giving an account of the progress of my intellect , I must not omit a circumstance which occurred in the beginning of the month of August of the same year ." "“ One night during my accustomed visit to the neighbouring wood where I collected my own food and brought home firing for my protectors , I found on the ground a leathern portmanteau containing several articles of dress and some books . I eagerly seized the prize and returned with it to my hovel . Fortunately the books were written in the language , the elements of which I had acquired at the cottage ; they consisted of _ Paradise Lost _ , a volume of _ Plutarch ’s Lives _ , and the _ Sorrows of Werter _ . The possession of these treasures gave me extreme delight ; I now continually studied and exercised my mind upon these histories , whilst my friends were employed in their ordinary occupations ." "“ I can hardly describe to you the effect of these books . They produced in me an infinity of new images and feelings , that sometimes raised me to ecstasy , but more frequently sunk me into the lowest dejection . In the _ Sorrows of Werter _ , besides the interest of its simple and affecting story , so many opinions are canvassed and so many lights thrown upon what had hitherto been to me obscure subjects that I found in it a never - ending source of speculation and astonishment . The gentle and domestic manners it described , combined with lofty sentiments and feelings , which had for their object something out of self , accorded well with my experience among my protectors and with the wants which were for ever alive in my own bosom . But I thought Werter himself a more divine being than I had ever beheld or imagined ; his character contained no pretension , but it sank deep . The disquisitions upon death and suicide were calculated to fill me with wonder . I did not pretend to enter into the merits of the case , yet I inclined towards the opinions of the hero , whose extinction I wept , without precisely understanding it ." "“ As I read , however , I applied much personally to my own feelings and condition . I found myself similar yet at the same time strangely unlike to the beings concerning whom I read and to whose conversation I was a listener . I sympathised with and partly understood them , but I was unformed in mind ; I was dependent on none and related to none . ‘ The path of my departure was free , ’ and there was none to lament my annihilation . My person was hideous and my stature gigantic . What did this mean ? Who was I ? What was I ? Whence did I come ? What was my destination ? These questions continually recurred , but I was unable to solve them ." "“ The volume of _ Plutarch ’s Lives _ which I possessed contained the histories of the first founders of the ancient republics . This book had a far different effect upon me from the _ Sorrows of Werter _ . I learned from Werter ’s imaginations despondency and gloom , but Plutarch taught me high thoughts ; he elevated me above the wretched sphere of my own reflections , to admire and love the heroes of past ages . Many things I read surpassed my understanding and experience . I had a very confused knowledge of kingdoms , wide extents of country , mighty rivers , and boundless seas . But I was perfectly unacquainted with towns and large assemblages of men . The cottage of my protectors had been the only school in which I had studied human nature , but this book developed new and mightier scenes of action . I read of men concerned in public affairs , governing or massacring their species . I felt the greatest ardour for virtue rise within me , and abhorrence for vice , as far as I understood the signification of those terms , relative as they were , as I applied them , to pleasure and pain alone . Induced by these feelings , I was of course led to admire peaceable lawgivers , Numa , Solon , and Lycurgus , in preference to Romulus and Theseus . The patriarchal lives of my protectors caused these impressions to take a firm hold on my mind ; perhaps , if my first introduction to humanity had been made by a young soldier , burning for glory and slaughter , I should have been imbued with different sensations ." "“ But _ Paradise Lost _ excited different and far deeper emotions . I read it , as I had read the other volumes which had fallen into my hands , as a true history . It moved every feeling of wonder and awe that the picture of an omnipotent God warring with his creatures was capable of exciting . I often referred the several situations , as their similarity struck me , to my own . Like Adam , I was apparently united by no link to any other being in existence ; but his state was far different from mine in every other respect . He had come forth from the hands of God a perfect creature , happy and prosperous , guarded by the especial care of his Creator ; he was allowed to converse with and acquire knowledge from beings of a superior nature , but I was wretched , helpless , and alone . Many times I considered Satan as the fitter emblem of my condition , for often , like him , when I viewed the bliss of my protectors , the bitter gall of envy rose within me ." "“ Another circumstance strengthened and confirmed these feelings . Soon after my arrival in the hovel I discovered some papers in the pocket of the dress which I had taken from your laboratory . At first I had neglected them , but now that I was able to decipher the characters in which they were written , I began to study them with diligence . It was your journal of the four months that preceded my creation . You minutely described in these papers every step you took in the progress of your work ; this history was mingled with accounts of domestic occurrences . You doubtless recollect these papers . Here they are . Everything is related in them which bears reference to my accursed origin ; the whole detail of that series of disgusting circumstances which produced it is set in view ; the minutest description of my odious and loathsome person is given , in language which painted your own horrors and rendered mine indelible . I sickened as I read . ‘ Hateful day when I received life ! ’ I exclaimed in agony . ‘ Accursed creator ! Why did you form a monster so hideous that even _ you _ turned from me in disgust ? God , in pity , made man beautiful and alluring , after his own image ; but my form is a filthy type of yours , more horrid even from the very resemblance . Satan had his companions , fellow devils , to admire and encourage him , but I am solitary and abhorred . ’" "“ These were the reflections of my hours of despondency and solitude ; but when I contemplated the virtues of the cottagers , their amiable and benevolent dispositions , I persuaded myself that when they should become acquainted with my admiration of their virtues they would compassionate me and overlook my personal deformity . Could they turn from their door one , however monstrous , who solicited their compassion and friendship ? I resolved , at least , not to despair , but in every way to fit myself for an interview with them which would decide my fate . I postponed this attempt for some months longer , for the importance attached to its success inspired me with a dread lest I should fail . Besides , I found that my understanding improved so much with every day ’s experience that I was unwilling to commence this undertaking until a few more months should have added to my sagacity ." "“ Several changes , in the meantime , took place in the cottage . The presence of Safie diffused happiness among its inhabitants , and I also found that a greater degree of plenty reigned there . Felix and Agatha spent more time in amusement and conversation , and were assisted in their labours by servants . They did not appear rich , but they were contented and happy ; their feelings were serene and peaceful , while mine became every day more tumultuous . Increase of knowledge only discovered to me more clearly what a wretched outcast I was . I cherished hope , it is true , but it vanished when I beheld my person reflected in water or my shadow in the moonshine , even as that frail image and that inconstant shade ." "“ I endeavoured to crush these fears and to fortify myself for the trial which in a few months I resolved to undergo ; and sometimes I allowed my thoughts , unchecked by reason , to ramble in the fields of Paradise , and dared to fancy amiable and lovely creatures sympathising with my feelings and cheering my gloom ; their angelic countenances breathed smiles of consolation . But it was all a dream ; no Eve soothed my sorrows nor shared my thoughts ; I was alone . I remembered Adam ’s supplication to his Creator . But where was mine ? He had abandoned me , and in the bitterness of my heart I cursed him ." "“ Autumn passed thus . I saw , with surprise and grief , the leaves decay and fall , and nature again assume the barren and bleak appearance it had worn when I first beheld the woods and the lovely moon . Yet I did not heed the bleakness of the weather ; I was better fitted by my conformation for the endurance of cold than heat . But my chief delights were the sight of the flowers , the birds , and all the gay apparel of summer ; when those deserted me , I turned with more attention towards the cottagers . Their happiness was not decreased by the absence of summer . They loved and sympathised with one another ; and their joys , depending on each other , were not interrupted by the casualties that took place around them . The more I saw of them , the greater became my desire to claim their protection and kindness ; my heart yearned to be known and loved by these amiable creatures ; to see their sweet looks directed towards me with affection was the utmost limit of my ambition . I dared not think that they would turn them from me with disdain and horror . The poor that stopped at their door were never driven away . I asked , it is true , for greater treasures than a little food or rest : I required kindness and sympathy ; but I did not believe myself utterly unworthy of it ." "“ The winter advanced , and an entire revolution of the seasons had taken place since I awoke into life . My attention at this time was solely directed towards my plan of introducing myself into the cottage of my protectors . I revolved many projects , but that on which I finally fixed was to enter the dwelling when the blind old man should be alone . I had sagacity enough to discover that the unnatural hideousness of my person was the chief object of horror with those who had formerly beheld me . My voice , although harsh , had nothing terrible in it ; I thought , therefore , that if in the absence of his children I could gain the good will and mediation of the old De Lacey , I might by his means be tolerated by my younger protectors ." "“ One day , when the sun shone on the red leaves that strewed the ground and diffused cheerfulness , although it denied warmth , Safie , Agatha , and Felix departed on a long country walk , and the old man , at his own desire , was left alone in the cottage . When his children had departed , he took up his guitar and played several mournful but sweet airs , more sweet and mournful than I had ever heard him play before . At first his countenance was illuminated with pleasure , but as he continued , thoughtfulness and sadness succeeded ; at length , laying aside the instrument , he sat absorbed in reflection ." "“ My heart beat quick ; this was the hour and moment of trial , which would decide my hopes or realise my fears . The servants were gone to a neighbouring fair . All was silent in and around the cottage ; it was an excellent opportunity ; yet , when I proceeded to execute my plan , my limbs failed me and I sank to the ground . Again I rose , and exerting all the firmness of which I was master , removed the planks which I had placed before my hovel to conceal my retreat . The fresh air revived me , and with renewed determination I approached the door of their cottage ." "“ I knocked . ‘ Who is there ? ’ said the old man . ‘ Come in . ’" "“ I entered . ‘ Pardon this intrusion , ’ said I ; ‘ I am a traveller in want of a little rest ; you would greatly oblige me if you would allow me to remain a few minutes before the fire . ’" "“ ‘ Enter , ’ said De Lacey , ‘ and I will try in what manner I can to relieve your wants ; but , unfortunately , my children are from home , and as I am blind , I am afraid I shall find it difficult to procure food for you . ’" "“ ‘ Do not trouble yourself , my kind host ; I have food ; it is warmth and rest only that I need . ’" "“ I sat down , and a silence ensued . I knew that every minute was precious to me , yet I remained irresolute in what manner to commence the interview , when the old man addressed me ." "“ ‘ No ; but I was educated by a French family and understand that language only . I am now going to claim the protection of some friends , whom I sincerely love , and of whose favour I have some hopes . ’" "“ ‘ Are they Germans ? ’" "“ ‘ No , they are French . But let us change the subject . I am an unfortunate and deserted creature , I look around and I have no relation or friend upon earth . These amiable people to whom I go have never seen me and know little of me . I am full of fears , for if I fail there , I am an outcast in the world for ever . ’" "“ ‘ Do not despair . To be friendless is indeed to be unfortunate , but the hearts of men , when unprejudiced by any obvious self - interest , are full of brotherly love and charity . Rely , therefore , on your hopes ; and if these friends are good and amiable , do not despair . ’" "“ ‘ They are kind — they are the most excellent creatures in the world ; but , unfortunately , they are prejudiced against me . I have good dispositions ; my life has been hitherto harmless and in some degree beneficial ; but a fatal prejudice clouds their eyes , and where they ought to see a feeling and kind friend , they behold only a detestable monster . ’" "“ ‘ That is indeed unfortunate ; but if you are really blameless , can not you undeceive them ? ’" "“ ‘ I am about to undertake that task ; and it is on that account that I feel so many overwhelming terrors . I tenderly love these friends ; I have , unknown to them , been for many months in the habits of daily kindness towards them ; but they believe that I wish to injure them , and it is that prejudice which I wish to overcome . ’" "“ ‘ Where do these friends reside ? ’" "“ ‘ Near this spot . ’" "“ The old man paused and then continued , ‘ If you will unreservedly confide to me the particulars of your tale , I perhaps may be of use in undeceiving them . I am blind and can not judge of your countenance , but there is something in your words which persuades me that you are sincere . I am poor and an exile , but it will afford me true pleasure to be in any way serviceable to a human creature . ’" "“ ‘ Excellent man ! I thank you and accept your generous offer . You raise me from the dust by this kindness ; and I trust that , by your aid , I shall not be driven from the society and sympathy of your fellow creatures . ’" "“ ‘ Heaven forbid ! Even if you were really criminal , for that can only drive you to desperation , and not instigate you to virtue . I also am unfortunate ; I and my family have been condemned , although innocent ; judge , therefore , if I do not feel for your misfortunes . ’" "“ ‘ How can I thank you , my best and only benefactor ? From your lips first have I heard the voice of kindness directed towards me ; I shall be for ever grateful ; and your present humanity assures me of success with those friends whom I am on the point of meeting . ’" "“ ‘ May I know the names and residence of those friends ? ’" "“ I paused . This , I thought , was the moment of decision , which was to rob me of or bestow happiness on me for ever . I struggled vainly for firmness sufficient to answer him , but the effort destroyed all my remaining strength ; I sank on the chair and sobbed aloud . At that moment I heard the steps of my younger protectors . I had not a moment to lose , but seizing the hand of the old man , I cried , ‘ Now is the time ! Save and protect me ! You and your family are the friends whom I seek . Do not you desert me in the hour of trial ! ’" "“ ‘ Great God ! ’ exclaimed the old man . ‘ Who are you ? ’" "“ At that instant the cottage door was opened , and Felix , Safie , and Agatha entered . Who can describe their horror and consternation on beholding me ? Agatha fainted , and Safie , unable to attend to her friend , rushed out of the cottage . Felix darted forward , and with supernatural force tore me from his father , to whose knees I clung , in a transport of fury , he dashed me to the ground and struck me violently with a stick . I could have torn him limb from limb , as the lion rends the antelope . But my heart sank within me as with bitter sickness , and I refrained . I saw him on the point of repeating his blow , when , overcome by pain and anguish , I quitted the cottage , and in the general tumult escaped unperceived to my hovel . ”" "“ Cursed , cursed creator ! Why did I live ? Why , in that instant , did I not extinguish the spark of existence which you had so wantonly bestowed ? I know not ; despair had not yet taken possession of me ; my feelings were those of rage and revenge . I could with pleasure have destroyed the cottage and its inhabitants and have glutted myself with their shrieks and misery ." "“ When night came I quitted my retreat and wandered in the wood ; and now , no longer restrained by the fear of discovery , I gave vent to my anguish in fearful howlings . I was like a wild beast that had broken the toils , destroying the objects that obstructed me and ranging through the wood with a stag - like swiftness . Oh ! What a miserable night I passed ! The cold stars shone in mockery , and the bare trees waved their branches above me ; now and then the sweet voice of a bird burst forth amidst the universal stillness . All , save I , were at rest or in enjoyment ; I , like the arch - fiend , bore a hell within me , and finding myself unsympathised with , wished to tear up the trees , spread havoc and destruction around me , and then to have sat down and enjoyed the ruin ." "“ But this was a luxury of sensation that could not endure ; I became fatigued with excess of bodily exertion and sank on the damp grass in the sick impotence of despair . There was none among the myriads of men that existed who would pity or assist me ; and should I feel kindness towards my enemies ? No ; from that moment I declared everlasting war against the species , and more than all , against him who had formed me and sent me forth to this insupportable misery ." "“ The sun rose ; I heard the voices of men and knew that it was impossible to return to my retreat during that day . Accordingly I hid myself in some thick underwood , determining to devote the ensuing hours to reflection on my situation ." "“ The pleasant sunshine and the pure air of day restored me to some degree of tranquillity ; and when I considered what had passed at the cottage , I could not help believing that I had been too hasty in my conclusions . I had certainly acted imprudently . It was apparent that my conversation had interested the father in my behalf , and I was a fool in having exposed my person to the horror of his children . I ought to have familiarised the old De Lacey to me , and by degrees to have discovered myself to the rest of his family , when they should have been prepared for my approach . But I did not believe my errors to be irretrievable , and after much consideration I resolved to return to the cottage , seek the old man , and by my representations win him to my party ." "“ These thoughts calmed me , and in the afternoon I sank into a profound sleep ; but the fever of my blood did not allow me to be visited by peaceful dreams . The horrible scene of the preceding day was for ever acting before my eyes ; the females were flying and the enraged Felix tearing me from his father ’s feet . I awoke exhausted , and finding that it was already night , I crept forth from my hiding - place , and went in search of food ." "“ When my hunger was appeased , I directed my steps towards the well - known path that conducted to the cottage . All there was at peace . I crept into my hovel and remained in silent expectation of the accustomed hour when the family arose . That hour passed , the sun mounted high in the heavens , but the cottagers did not appear . I trembled violently , apprehending some dreadful misfortune . The inside of the cottage was dark , and I heard no motion ; I can not describe the agony of this suspense ." "“ Presently two countrymen passed by , but pausing near the cottage , they entered into conversation , using violent gesticulations ; but I did not understand what they said , as they spoke the language of the country , which differed from that of my protectors . Soon after , however , Felix approached with another man ; I was surprised , as I knew that he had not quitted the cottage that morning , and waited anxiously to discover from his discourse the meaning of these unusual appearances ." "“ ‘ Do you consider , ’ said his companion to him , ‘ that you will be obliged to pay three months ’ rent and to lose the produce of your garden ? I do not wish to take any unfair advantage , and I beg therefore that you will take some days to consider of your determination . ’" "“ ‘ It is utterly useless , ’ replied Felix ; ‘ we can never again inhabit your cottage . The life of my father is in the greatest danger , owing to the dreadful circumstance that I have related . My wife and my sister will never recover from their horror . I entreat you not to reason with me any more . Take possession of your tenement and let me fly from this place . ’" "“ Felix trembled violently as he said this . He and his companion entered the cottage , in which they remained for a few minutes , and then departed . I never saw any of the family of De Lacey more ." "“ I continued for the remainder of the day in my hovel in a state of utter and stupid despair . My protectors had departed and had broken the only link that held me to the world . For the first time the feelings of revenge and hatred filled my bosom , and I did not strive to control them , but allowing myself to be borne away by the stream , I bent my mind towards injury and death . When I thought of my friends , of the mild voice of De Lacey , the gentle eyes of Agatha , and the exquisite beauty of the Arabian , these thoughts vanished and a gush of tears somewhat soothed me . But again when I reflected that they had spurned and deserted me , anger returned , a rage of anger , and unable to injure anything human , I turned my fury towards inanimate objects . As night advanced , I placed a variety of combustibles around the cottage , and after having destroyed every vestige of cultivation in the garden , I waited with forced impatience until the moon had sunk to commence my operations ." "“ As the night advanced , a fierce wind arose from the woods and quickly dispersed the clouds that had loitered in the heavens ; the blast tore along like a mighty avalanche and produced a kind of insanity in my spirits that burst all bounds of reason and reflection . I lighted the dry branch of a tree and danced with fury around the devoted cottage , my eyes still fixed on the western horizon , the edge of which the moon nearly touched . A part of its orb was at length hid , and I waved my brand ; it sank , and with a loud scream I fired the straw , and heath , and bushes , which I had collected . The wind fanned the fire , and the cottage was quickly enveloped by the flames , which clung to it and licked it with their forked and destroying tongues ." "“ As soon as I was convinced that no assistance could save any part of the habitation , I quitted the scene and sought for refuge in the woods ." "“ And now , with the world before me , whither should I bend my steps ? I resolved to fly far from the scene of my misfortunes ; but to me , hated and despised , every country must be equally horrible . At length the thought of you crossed my mind . I learned from your papers that you were my father , my creator ; and to whom could I apply with more fitness than to him who had given me life ? Among the lessons that Felix had bestowed upon Safie , geography had not been omitted ; I had learned from these the relative situations of the different countries of the earth . You had mentioned Geneva as the name of your native town , and towards this place I resolved to proceed ." "“ But how was I to direct myself ? I knew that I must travel in a southwesterly direction to reach my destination , but the sun was my only guide . I did not know the names of the towns that I was to pass through , nor could I ask information from a single human being ; but I did not despair . From you only could I hope for succour , although towards you I felt no sentiment but that of hatred . Unfeeling , heartless creator ! You had endowed me with perceptions and passions and then cast me abroad an object for the scorn and horror of mankind . But on you only had I any claim for pity and redress , and from you I determined to seek that justice which I vainly attempted to gain from any other being that wore the human form ." "“ My travels were long and the sufferings I endured intense . It was late in autumn when I quitted the district where I had so long resided . I travelled only at night , fearful of encountering the visage of a human being . Nature decayed around me , and the sun became heatless ; rain and snow poured around me ; mighty rivers were frozen ; the surface of the earth was hard and chill , and bare , and I found no shelter . Oh , earth ! How often did I imprecate curses on the cause of my being ! The mildness of my nature had fled , and all within me was turned to gall and bitterness . The nearer I approached to your habitation , the more deeply did I feel the spirit of revenge enkindled in my heart . Snow fell , and the waters were hardened , but I rested not . A few incidents now and then directed me , and I possessed a map of the country ; but I often wandered wide from my path . The agony of my feelings allowed me no respite ; no incident occurred from which my rage and misery could not extract its food ; but a circumstance that happened when I arrived on the confines of Switzerland , when the sun had recovered its warmth and the earth again began to look green , confirmed in an especial manner the bitterness and horror of my feelings ." "“ I generally rested during the day and travelled only when I was secured by night from the view of man . One morning , however , finding that my path lay through a deep wood , I ventured to continue my journey after the sun had risen ; the day , which was one of the first of spring , cheered even me by the loveliness of its sunshine and the balminess of the air . I felt emotions of gentleness and pleasure , that had long appeared dead , revive within me . Half surprised by the novelty of these sensations , I allowed myself to be borne away by them , and forgetting my solitude and deformity , dared to be happy . Soft tears again bedewed my cheeks , and I even raised my humid eyes with thankfulness towards the blessed sun , which bestowed such joy upon me ." "“ I continued to wind among the paths of the wood , until I came to its boundary , which was skirted by a deep and rapid river , into which many of the trees bent their branches , now budding with the fresh spring . Here I paused , not exactly knowing what path to pursue , when I heard the sound of voices , that induced me to conceal myself under the shade of a cypress . I was scarcely hid when a young girl came running towards the spot where I was concealed , laughing , as if she ran from someone in sport . She continued her course along the precipitous sides of the river , when suddenly her foot slipped , and she fell into the rapid stream . I rushed from my hiding - place and with extreme labour , from the force of the current , saved her and dragged her to shore . She was senseless , and I endeavoured by every means in my power to restore animation , when I was suddenly interrupted by the approach of a rustic , who was probably the person from whom she had playfully fled . On seeing me , he darted towards me , and tearing the girl from my arms , hastened towards the deeper parts of the wood . I followed speedily , I hardly knew why ; but when the man saw me draw near , he aimed a gun , which he carried , at my body and fired . I sank to the ground , and my injurer , with increased swiftness , escaped into the wood ." "“ This was then the reward of my benevolence ! I had saved a human being from destruction , and as a recompense I now writhed under the miserable pain of a wound which shattered the flesh and bone . The feelings of kindness and gentleness which I had entertained but a few moments before gave place to hellish rage and gnashing of teeth . Inflamed by pain , I vowed eternal hatred and vengeance to all mankind . But the agony of my wound overcame me ; my pulses paused , and I fainted ." "“ For some weeks I led a miserable life in the woods , endeavouring to cure the wound which I had received . The ball had entered my shoulder , and I knew not whether it had remained there or passed through ; at any rate I had no means of extracting it . My sufferings were augmented also by the oppressive sense of the injustice and ingratitude of their infliction . My daily vows rose for revenge — a deep and deadly revenge , such as would alone compensate for the outrages and anguish I had endured ." "“ After some weeks my wound healed , and I continued my journey . The labours I endured were no longer to be alleviated by the bright sun or gentle breezes of spring ; all joy was but a mockery which insulted my desolate state and made me feel more painfully that I was not made for the enjoyment of pleasure ." "“ But my toils now drew near a close , and in two months from this time I reached the environs of Geneva ." "“ It was evening when I arrived , and I retired to a hiding - place among the fields that surround it to meditate in what manner I should apply to you . I was oppressed by fatigue and hunger and far too unhappy to enjoy the gentle breezes of evening or the prospect of the sun setting behind the stupendous mountains of Jura ." "“ At this time a slight sleep relieved me from the pain of reflection , which was disturbed by the approach of a beautiful child , who came running into the recess I had chosen , with all the sportiveness of infancy . Suddenly , as I gazed on him , an idea seized me that this little creature was unprejudiced and had lived too short a time to have imbibed a horror of deformity . If , therefore , I could seize him and educate him as my companion and friend , I should not be so desolate in this peopled earth ." "“ Urged by this impulse , I seized on the boy as he passed and drew him towards me . As soon as he beheld my form , he placed his hands before his eyes and uttered a shrill scream ; I drew his hand forcibly from his face and said , ‘ Child , what is the meaning of this ? I do not intend to hurt you ; listen to me . ’" "“ He struggled violently . ‘ Let me go , ’ he cried ; ‘ monster ! Ugly wretch ! You wish to eat me and tear me to pieces . You are an ogre . Let me go , or I will tell my papa . ’" "“ ‘ Boy , you will never see your father again ; you must come with me . ’" "“ ‘ Hideous monster ! Let me go . My papa is a syndic — he is M. Frankenstein — he will punish you . You dare not keep me . ’" "“ ‘ Frankenstein ! you belong then to my enemy — to him towards whom I have sworn eternal revenge ; you shall be my first victim . ’" "“ The child still struggled and loaded me with epithets which carried despair to my heart ; I grasped his throat to silence him , and in a moment he lay dead at my feet ." "“ I gazed on my victim , and my heart swelled with exultation and hellish triumph ; clapping my hands , I exclaimed , ‘ I too can create desolation ; my enemy is not invulnerable ; this death will carry despair to him , and a thousand other miseries shall torment and destroy him . ’" "“ As I fixed my eyes on the child , I saw something glittering on his breast . I took it ; it was a portrait of a most lovely woman . In spite of my malignity , it softened and attracted me . For a few moments I gazed with delight on her dark eyes , fringed by deep lashes , and her lovely lips ; but presently my rage returned ; I remembered that I was for ever deprived of the delights that such beautiful creatures could bestow and that she whose resemblance I contemplated would , in regarding me , have changed that air of divine benignity to one expressive of disgust and affright ." "“ Can you wonder that such thoughts transported me with rage ? I only wonder that at that moment , instead of venting my sensations in exclamations and agony , I did not rush among mankind and perish in the attempt to destroy them ." "“ While I was overcome by these feelings , I left the spot where I had committed the murder , and seeking a more secluded hiding - place , I entered a barn which had appeared to me to be empty . A woman was sleeping on some straw ; she was young , not indeed so beautiful as her whose portrait I held , but of an agreeable aspect and blooming in the loveliness of youth and health . Here , I thought , is one of those whose joy - imparting smiles are bestowed on all but me . And then I bent over her and whispered , ‘ Awake , fairest , thy lover is near — he who would give his life but to obtain one look of affection from thine eyes ; my beloved , awake ! ’" "“ The sleeper stirred ; a thrill of terror ran through me . Should she indeed awake , and see me , and curse me , and denounce the murderer ? Thus would she assuredly act if her darkened eyes opened and she beheld me . The thought was madness ; it stirred the fiend within me — not I , but she , shall suffer ; the murder I have committed because I am for ever robbed of all that she could give me , she shall atone . The crime had its source in her ; be hers the punishment ! Thanks to the lessons of Felix and the sanguinary laws of man , I had learned now to work mischief . I bent over her and placed the portrait securely in one of the folds of her dress . She moved again , and I fled ." "“ For some days I haunted the spot where these scenes had taken place , sometimes wishing to see you , sometimes resolved to quit the world and its miseries for ever . At length I wandered towards these mountains , and have ranged through their immense recesses , consumed by a burning passion which you alone can gratify . We may not part until you have promised to comply with my requisition . I am alone and miserable ; man will not associate with me ; but one as deformed and horrible as myself would not deny herself to me . My companion must be of the same species and have the same defects . This being you must create . ”" "“ You must create a female for me with whom I can live in the interchange of those sympathies necessary for my being . This you alone can do , and I demand it of you as a right which you must not refuse to concede . ”" "“ I do refuse it , ”" "“ and no torture shall ever extort a consent from me . You may render me the most miserable of men , but you shall never make me base in my own eyes . Shall I create another like yourself , whose joint wickedness might desolate the world . Begone ! I have answered you ; you may torture me , but I will never consent . ”" "“ You are in the wrong , ”" "“ and instead of threatening , I am content to reason with you . I am malicious because I am miserable . Am I not shunned and hated by all mankind ? You , my creator , would tear me to pieces and triumph ; remember that , and tell me why I should pity man more than he pities me ? You would not call it murder if you could precipitate me into one of those ice - rifts and destroy my frame , the work of your own hands . Shall I respect man when he condemns me ? Let him live with me in the interchange of kindness , and instead of injury I would bestow every benefit upon him with tears of gratitude at his acceptance . But that can not be ; the human senses are insurmountable barriers to our union . Yet mine shall not be the submission of abject slavery . I will revenge my injuries ; if I can not inspire love , I will cause fear , and chiefly towards you my arch - enemy , because my creator , do I swear inextinguishable hatred . Have a care ; I will work at your destruction , nor finish until I desolate your heart , so that you shall curse the hour of your birth . ”" "“ I intended to reason . This passion is detrimental to me , for you do not reflect that _ you _ are the cause of its excess . If any being felt emotions of benevolence towards me , I should return them a hundred and a hundredfold ; for that one creature ’s sake I would make peace with the whole kind ! But I now indulge in dreams of bliss that can not be realised . What I ask of you is reasonable and moderate ; I demand a creature of another sex , but as hideous as myself ; the gratification is small , but it is all that I can receive , and it shall content me . It is true , we shall be monsters , cut off from all the world ; but on that account we shall be more attached to one another . Our lives will not be happy , but they will be harmless and free from the misery I now feel . Oh ! My creator , make me happy ; let me feel gratitude towards you for one benefit ! Let me see that I excite the sympathy of some existing thing ; do not deny me my request ! ”" "“ If you consent , neither you nor any other human being shall ever see us again ; I will go to the vast wilds of South America . My food is not that of man ; I do not destroy the lamb and the kid to glut my appetite ; acorns and berries afford me sufficient nourishment . My companion will be of the same nature as myself and will be content with the same fare . We shall make our bed of dried leaves ; the sun will shine on us as on man and will ripen our food . The picture I present to you is peaceful and human , and you must feel that you could deny it only in the wantonness of power and cruelty . Pitiless as you have been towards me , I now see compassion in your eyes ; let me seize the favourable moment and persuade you to promise what I so ardently desire . ”" "“ You propose , ”" "“ to fly from the habitations of man , to dwell in those wilds where the beasts of the field will be your only companions . How can you , who long for the love and sympathy of man , persevere in this exile ? You will return and again seek their kindness , and you will meet with their detestation ; your evil passions will be renewed , and you will then have a companion to aid you in the task of destruction . This may not be ; cease to argue the point , for I can not consent . ”" "“ How inconstant are your feelings ! But a moment ago you were moved by my representations , and why do you again harden yourself to my complaints ? I swear to you , by the earth which I inhabit , and by you that made me , that with the companion you bestow , I will quit the neighbourhood of man and dwell , as it may chance , in the most savage of places . My evil passions will have fled , for I shall meet with sympathy ! My life will flow quietly away , and in my dying moments I shall not curse my maker . ”" "“ You swear , ”" "“ to be harmless ; but have you not already shown a degree of malice that should reasonably make me distrust you ? May not even this be a feint that will increase your triumph by affording a wider scope for your revenge ? ”" "“ How is this ? I must not be trifled with , and I demand an answer . If I have no ties and no affections , hatred and vice must be my portion ; the love of another will destroy the cause of my crimes , and I shall become a thing of whose existence everyone will be ignorant . My vices are the children of a forced solitude that I abhor , and my virtues will necessarily arise when I live in communion with an equal . I shall feel the affections of a sensitive being and become linked to the chain of existence and events from which I am now excluded . ”" "“ I consent to your demand , on your solemn oath to quit Europe for ever , and every other place in the neighbourhood of man , as soon as I shall deliver into your hands a female who will accompany you in your exile . ”" "“ I swear , ”" "“ by the sun , and by the blue sky of heaven , and by the fire of love that burns my heart , that if you grant my prayer , while they exist you shall never behold me again . Depart to your home and commence your labours ; I shall watch their progress with unutterable anxiety ; and fear not but that when you are ready I shall appear . ”" "“ Oh ! stars and clouds and winds , ye are all about to mock me ; if ye really pity me , crush sensation and memory ; let me become as nought ; but if not , depart , depart , and leave me in darkness . ”" "“ I am happy to remark , my dear son , that you have resumed your former pleasures and seem to be returning to yourself . And yet you are still unhappy and still avoid our society . For some time I was lost in conjecture as to the cause of this , but yesterday an idea struck me , and if it is well founded , I conjure you to avow it . Reserve on such a point would be not only useless , but draw down treble misery on us all . ”" "“ I confess , my son , that I have always looked forward to your marriage with our dear Elizabeth as the tie of our domestic comfort and the stay of my declining years . You were attached to each other from your earliest infancy ; you studied together , and appeared , in dispositions and tastes , entirely suited to one another . But so blind is the experience of man that what I conceived to be the best assistants to my plan may have entirely destroyed it . You , perhaps , regard her as your sister , without any wish that she might become your wife . Nay , you may have met with another whom you may love ; and considering yourself as bound in honour to Elizabeth , this struggle may occasion the poignant misery which you appear to feel . ”" "“ My dear father , reassure yourself . I love my cousin tenderly and sincerely . I never saw any woman who excited , as Elizabeth does , my warmest admiration and affection . My future hopes and prospects are entirely bound up in the expectation of our union . ”" "“ Do you , ”" "“ enjoy yourself , and let this be our rendezvous . I may be absent a month or two ; but do not interfere with my motions , I entreat you ; leave me to peace and solitude for a short time ; and when I return , I hope it will be with a lighter heart , more congenial to your own temper . ”" "“ You have destroyed the work which you began ; what is it that you intend ? Do you dare to break your promise ? I have endured toil and misery ; I left Switzerland with you ; I crept along the shores of the Rhine , among its willow islands and over the summits of its hills . I have dwelt many months in the heaths of England and among the deserts of Scotland . I have endured incalculable fatigue , and cold , and hunger ; do you dare destroy my hopes ? ”" "“ Begone ! I do break my promise ; never will I create another like yourself , equal in deformity and wickedness . ”" "“ Slave , I before reasoned with you , but you have proved yourself unworthy of my condescension . Remember that I have power ; you believe yourself miserable , but I can make you so wretched that the light of day will be hateful to you . You are my creator , but I am your master ; obey ! ”" "“ The hour of my irresolution is past , and the period of your power is arrived . Your threats can not move me to do an act of wickedness ; but they confirm me in a determination of not creating you a companion in vice . Shall I , in cool blood , set loose upon the earth a dæmon whose delight is in death and wretchedness ? Begone ! I am firm , and your words will only exasperate my rage . ”" "“ Shall each man , ”" "“ find a wife for his bosom , and each beast have his mate , and I be alone ? I had feelings of affection , and they were requited by detestation and scorn . Man ! You may hate , but beware ! Your hours will pass in dread and misery , and soon the bolt will fall which must ravish from you your happiness for ever . Are you to be happy while I grovel in the intensity of my wretchedness ? You can blast my other passions , but revenge remains — revenge , henceforth dearer than light or food ! I may die , but first you , my tyrant and tormentor , shall curse the sun that gazes on your misery . Beware , for I am fearless and therefore powerful . I will watch with the wiliness of a snake , that I may sting with its venom . Man , you shall repent of the injuries you inflict . ”" "“ Devil , cease ; and do not poison the air with these sounds of malice . I have declared my resolution to you , and I am no coward to bend beneath words . Leave me ; I am inexorable . ”" "“ It is well . I go ; but remember , I shall be with you on your wedding - night . ”" "“ Villain ! Before you sign my death - warrant , be sure that you are yourself safe . ”" "words—“_I will be with you on your wedding - night . _ ”" "“ Fiend , ”" "“ your task is already fulfilled ! ”" "“ My good friends , ”" "“ will you be so kind as to tell me the name of this town and inform me where I am ? ”" "“ You will know that soon enough , ”" "“ Maybe you are come to a place that will not prove much to your taste , but you will not be consulted as to your quarters , I promise you . ”" "“ Why do you answer me so roughly ? ”" "“ Surely it is not the custom of Englishmen to receive strangers so inhospitably . ”" "“ I do not know , ”" "“ what the custom of the English may be , but it is the custom of the Irish to hate villains . ”" "“ Come , sir , you must follow me to Mr. Kirwin ’s to give an account of yourself . ”" "“ Who is Mr. Kirwin ? Why am I to give an account of myself ? Is not this a free country ? ”" "“ Ay , sir , free enough for honest folks . Mr. Kirwin is a magistrate , and you are to give an account of the death of a gentleman who was found murdered here last night . ”" "“ Have my murderous machinations deprived you also , my dearest Henry , of life ? Two I have already destroyed ; other victims await their destiny ; but you , Clerval , my friend , my benefactor — ”" "“ I believe I am ; but if it be all true , if indeed I did not dream , I am sorry that I am still alive to feel this misery and horror . ”" "“ For that matter , ”" "“ if you mean about the gentleman you murdered , I believe that it were better for you if you were dead , for I fancy it will go hard with you ! However , that ’s none of my business ; I am sent to nurse you and get you well ; I do my duty with a safe conscience ; it were well if everybody did the same . ”" "“ I fear that this place is very shocking to you ; can I do anything to make you more comfortable ? ”" "“ I thank you , but all that you mention is nothing to me ; on the whole earth there is no comfort which I am capable of receiving . ”" "“ I know that the sympathy of a stranger can be but of little relief to one borne down as you are by so strange a misfortune . But you will , I hope , soon quit this melancholy abode , for doubtless evidence can easily be brought to free you from the criminal charge . ”" "“ That is my least concern ; I am , by a course of strange events , become the most miserable of mortals . Persecuted and tortured as I am and have been , can death be any evil to me ? ”" "“ Nothing indeed could be more unfortunate and agonising than the strange chances that have lately occurred . You were thrown , by some surprising accident , on this shore , renowned for its hospitality , seized immediately , and charged with murder . The first sight that was presented to your eyes was the body of your friend , murdered in so unaccountable a manner and placed , as it were , by some fiend across your path . ”" "“ Immediately upon your being taken ill , all the papers that were on your person were brought me , and I examined them that I might discover some trace by which I could send to your relations an account of your misfortune and illness . I found several letters , and , among others , one which I discovered from its commencement to be from your father . I instantly wrote to Geneva ; nearly two months have elapsed since the departure of my letter . But you are ill ; even now you tremble ; you are unfit for agitation of any kind . ”" "“ This suspense is a thousand times worse than the most horrible event ; tell me what new scene of death has been acted , and whose murder I am now to lament ? ”" "“ Your family is perfectly well , ”" "“ and someone , a friend , is come to visit you . ”" "“ Oh ! Take him away ! I can not see him ; for God ’s sake , do not let him enter ! ”" "“ I should have thought , young man , that the presence of your father would have been welcome instead of inspiring such violent repugnance . ”" "“ My father ! ”" "“ Is my father indeed come ? How kind , how very kind ! But where is he , why does he not hasten to me ? ”" "“ Are you then safe — and Elizabeth — and Ernest ? ”" "“ What a place is this that you inhabit , my son ! ”" "“ You travelled to seek happiness , but a fatality seems to pursue you . And poor Clerval — ”" "“ Alas ! Yes , my father , ”" "“ some destiny of the most horrible kind hangs over me , and I must live to fulfil it , or surely I should have died on the coffin of Henry . ”" "“ Alas ! My father , ”" "“ how little do you know me . Human beings , their feelings and passions , would indeed be degraded if such a wretch as I felt pride . Justine , poor unhappy Justine , was as innocent as I , and she suffered the same charge ; she died for it ; and I am the cause of this — I murdered her . William , Justine , and Henry — they all died by my hands . ”" "“ My dearest Victor , what infatuation is this ? My dear son , I entreat you never to make such an assertion again . ”" "“ I am not mad , ”" "“ the sun and the heavens , who have viewed my operations , can bear witness of my truth . I am the assassin of those most innocent victims ; they died by my machinations . A thousand times would I have shed my own blood , drop by drop , to have saved their lives ; but I could not , my father , indeed I could not sacrifice the whole human race . ”" "“ My dear Friend ," "“ It gave me the greatest pleasure to receive a letter from my uncle dated at Paris ; you are no longer at a formidable distance , and I may hope to see you in less than a fortnight . My poor cousin , how much you must have suffered ! I expect to see you looking even more ill than when you quitted Geneva . This winter has been passed most miserably , tortured as I have been by anxious suspense ; yet I hope to see peace in your countenance and to find that your heart is not totally void of comfort and tranquillity ." "“ Yet I fear that the same feelings now exist that made you so miserable a year ago , even perhaps augmented by time . I would not disturb you at this period , when so many misfortunes weigh upon you , but a conversation that I had with my uncle previous to his departure renders some explanation necessary before we meet ." "“ You well know , Victor , that our union had been the favourite plan of your parents ever since our infancy . We were told this when young , and taught to look forward to it as an event that would certainly take place . We were affectionate playfellows during childhood , and , I believe , dear and valued friends to one another as we grew older . But as brother and sister often entertain a lively affection towards each other without desiring a more intimate union , may not such also be our case ? Tell me , dearest Victor . Answer me , I conjure you by our mutual happiness , with simple truth — Do you not love another ?" "“ You have travelled ; you have spent several years of your life at Ingolstadt ; and I confess to you , my friend , that when I saw you last autumn so unhappy , flying to solitude from the society of every creature , I could not help supposing that you might regret our connection and believe yourself bound in honour to fulfil the wishes of your parents , although they opposed themselves to your inclinations . But this is false reasoning . I confess to you , my friend , that I love you and that in my airy dreams of futurity you have been my constant friend and companion . But it is your happiness I desire as well as my own when I declare to you that our marriage would render me eternally miserable unless it were the dictate of your own free choice . Even now I weep to think that , borne down as you are by the cruellest misfortunes , you may stifle , by the word _ honour _ , all hope of that love and happiness which would alone restore you to yourself . I , who have so disinterested an affection for you , may increase your miseries tenfold by being an obstacle to your wishes . Ah ! Victor , be assured that your cousin and playmate has too sincere a love for you not to be made miserable by this supposition . Be happy , my friend ; and if you obey me in this one request , remain satisfied that nothing on earth will have the power to interrupt my tranquillity ." "“ Do not let this letter disturb you ; do not answer tomorrow , or the next day , or even until you come , if it will give you pain . My uncle will send me news of your health , and if I see but one smile on your lips when we meet , occasioned by this or any other exertion of mine , I shall need no other happiness ." "“ Elizabeth Lavenza ." "“ Geneva , May 18th , 17 — ”" "fiend—“_I will be with you on your wedding - night ! _ ”" "“ I fear , my beloved girl , ”" "“ little happiness remains for us on earth ; yet all that I may one day enjoy is centred in you . Chase away your idle fears ; to you alone do I consecrate my life and my endeavours for contentment . I have one secret , Elizabeth , a dreadful one ; when revealed to you , it will chill your frame with horror , and then , far from being surprised at my misery , you will only wonder that I survive what I have endured . I will confide this tale of misery and terror to you the day after our marriage shall take place , for , my sweet cousin , there must be perfect confidence between us . But until then , I conjure you , do not mention or allude to it . This I most earnestly entreat , and I know you will comply . ”" "“ Have you , then , some other attachment ? ”" "“ None on earth . I love Elizabeth and look forward to our union with delight . Let the day therefore be fixed ; and on it I will consecrate myself , in life or death , to the happiness of my cousin . ”" "“ My dear Victor , do not speak thus . Heavy misfortunes have befallen us , but let us only cling closer to what remains and transfer our love for those whom we have lost to those who yet live . Our circle will be small but bound close by the ties of affection and mutual misfortune . And when time shall have softened your despair , new and dear objects of care will be born to replace those of whom we have been so cruelly deprived . ”" "“ _ I shall be with you on your wedding - night _ , ”" "“ You are sorrowful , my love . Ah ! If you knew what I have suffered and what I may yet endure , you would endeavour to let me taste the quiet and freedom from despair that this one day at least permits me to enjoy . ”" "“ Oh ! Peace , peace , my love , ”" "“ this night , and all will be safe ; but this night is dreadful , very dreadful . ”" "“ Be assured , sir , ”" "“ no pains or exertions on my part shall be spared to discover the villain . ”" "“ I thank you , ”" "“ listen , therefore , to the deposition that I have to make . It is indeed a tale so strange that I should fear you would not credit it were there not something in truth which , however wonderful , forces conviction . The story is too connected to be mistaken for a dream , and I have no motive for falsehood . ”" "“ This is the being whom I accuse and for whose seizure and punishment I call upon you to exert your whole power . It is your duty as a magistrate , and I believe and hope that your feelings as a man will not revolt from the execution of those functions on this occasion . ”" "“ I would willingly afford you every aid in your pursuit , but the creature of whom you speak appears to have powers which would put all my exertions to defiance . Who can follow an animal which can traverse the sea of ice and inhabit caves and dens where no man would venture to intrude ? Besides , some months have elapsed since the commission of his crimes , and no one can conjecture to what place he has wandered or what region he may now inhabit . ”" "“ I do not doubt that he hovers near the spot which I inhabit , and if he has indeed taken refuge in the Alps , he may be hunted like the chamois and destroyed as a beast of prey . But I perceive your thoughts ; you do not credit my narrative and do not intend to pursue my enemy with the punishment which is his desert . ”" "“ You are mistaken , ”" "“ I will exert myself , and if it is in my power to seize the monster , be assured that he shall suffer punishment proportionate to his crimes . But I fear , from what you have yourself described to be his properties , that this will prove impracticable ; and thus , while every proper measure is pursued , you should make up your mind to disappointment . ”" "“ That can not be ; but all that I can say will be of little avail . My revenge is of no moment to you ; yet , while I allow it to be a vice , I confess that it is the devouring and only passion of my soul . My rage is unspeakable when I reflect that the murderer , whom I have turned loose upon society , still exists . You refuse my just demand ; I have but one resource , and I devote myself , either in my life or death , to his destruction . ”" "“ Man , ”" "“ how ignorant art thou in thy pride of wisdom ! Cease ; you know not what it is you say . ”" "“ By the sacred earth on which I kneel , by the shades that wander near me , by the deep and eternal grief that I feel , I swear ; and by thee , O Night , and the spirits that preside over thee , to pursue the dæmon who caused this misery , until he or I shall perish in mortal conflict . For this purpose I will preserve my life ; to execute this dear revenge will I again behold the sun and tread the green herbage of earth , which otherwise should vanish from my eyes for ever . And I call on you , spirits of the dead , and on you , wandering ministers of vengeance , to aid and conduct me in my work . Let the cursed and hellish monster drink deep of agony ; let him feel the despair that now torments me . ”" "“ I am satisfied , miserable wretch ! You have determined to live , and I am satisfied . ”" "“ My reign is not yet over”—these" "inscriptions—“you live , and my power is complete . Follow me ; I seek the everlasting ices of the north , where you will feel the misery of cold and frost , to which I am impassive . You will find near this place , if you follow not too tardily , a dead hare ; eat and be refreshed . Come on , my enemy ; we have yet to wrestle for our lives , but many hard and miserable hours must you endure until that period shall arrive . ”" "“ When younger , ”" "“ I believed myself destined for some great enterprise . My feelings are profound , but I possessed a coolness of judgment that fitted me for illustrious achievements . This sentiment of the worth of my nature supported me when others would have been oppressed , for I deemed it criminal to throw away in useless grief those talents that might be useful to my fellow creatures . When I reflected on the work I had completed , no less a one than the creation of a sensitive and rational animal , I could not rank myself with the herd of common projectors . But this thought , which supported me in the commencement of my career , now serves only to plunge me lower in the dust . All my speculations and hopes are as nothing , and like the archangel who aspired to omnipotence , I am chained in an eternal hell . My imagination was vivid , yet my powers of analysis and application were intense ; by the union of these qualities I conceived the idea and executed the creation of a man . Even now I can not recollect without passion my reveries while the work was incomplete . I trod heaven in my thoughts , now exulting in my powers , now burning with the idea of their effects . From my infancy I was imbued with high hopes and a lofty ambition ; but how am I sunk ! Oh ! My friend , if you had known me as I once was , you would not recognise me in this state of degradation . Despondency rarely visited my heart ; a high destiny seemed to bear me on , until I fell , never , never again to rise . ”" "“ I thank you , Walton , ”" "“ for your kind intentions towards so miserable a wretch ; but when you speak of new ties and fresh affections , think you that any can replace those who are gone ? Can any man be to me as Clerval was , or any woman another Elizabeth ? Even where the affections are not strongly moved by any superior excellence , the companions of our childhood always possess a certain power over our minds which hardly any later friend can obtain . They know our infantine dispositions , which , however they may be afterwards modified , are never eradicated ; and they can judge of our actions with more certain conclusions as to the integrity of our motives . A sister or a brother can never , unless indeed such symptoms have been shown early , suspect the other of fraud or false dealing , when another friend , however strongly he may be attached , may , in spite of himself , be contemplated with suspicion . But I enjoyed friends , dear not only through habit and association , but from their own merits ; and wherever I am , the soothing voice of my Elizabeth and the conversation of Clerval will be ever whispered in my ear . They are dead , and but one feeling in such a solitude can persuade me to preserve my life . If I were engaged in any high undertaking or design , fraught with extensive utility to my fellow creatures , then could I live to fulfil it . But such is not my destiny ; I must pursue and destroy the being to whom I gave existence ; then my lot on earth will be fulfilled and I may die . ”" "“ because they will soon return to England . ”" "“ Alas ! Yes ; I can not withstand their demands . I can not lead them unwillingly to danger , and I must return . ”" "“ Do so , if you will ; but I will not . You may give up your purpose , but mine is assigned to me by Heaven , and I dare not . I am weak , but surely the spirits who assist my vengeance will endow me with sufficient strength . ”" "“ Alas ! The strength I relied on is gone ; I feel that I shall soon die , and he , my enemy and persecutor , may still be in being . Think not , Walton , that in the last moments of my existence I feel that burning hatred and ardent desire of revenge I once expressed ; but I feel myself justified in desiring the death of my adversary . During these last days I have been occupied in examining my past conduct ; nor do I find it blamable . In a fit of enthusiastic madness I created a rational creature and was bound towards him to assure , as far as was in my power , his happiness and well - being . This was my duty , but there was another still paramount to that . My duties towards the beings of my own species had greater claims to my attention because they included a greater proportion of happiness or misery . Urged by this view , I refused , and I did right in refusing , to create a companion for the first creature . He showed unparalleled malignity and selfishness in evil ; he destroyed my friends ; he devoted to destruction beings who possessed exquisite sensations , happiness , and wisdom ; nor do I know where this thirst for vengeance may end . Miserable himself that he may render no other wretched , he ought to die . The task of his destruction was mine , but I have failed . When actuated by selfish and vicious motives , I asked you to undertake my unfinished work , and I renew this request now , when I am only induced by reason and virtue ." "“ Yet I can not ask you to renounce your country and friends to fulfil this task ; and now that you are returning to England , you will have little chance of meeting with him . But the consideration of these points , and the well balancing of what you may esteem your duties , I leave to you ; my judgment and ideas are already disturbed by the near approach of death . I dare not ask you to do what I think right , for I may still be misled by passion ." "“ That he should live to be an instrument of mischief disturbs me ; in other respects , this hour , when I momentarily expect my release , is the only happy one which I have enjoyed for several years . The forms of the beloved dead flit before me , and I hasten to their arms . Farewell , Walton ! Seek happiness in tranquillity and avoid ambition , even if it be only the apparently innocent one of distinguishing yourself in science and discoveries . Yet why do I say this ? I have myself been blasted in these hopes , yet another may succeed . ”" "“ That is also my victim ! ”" "“ In his murder my crimes are consummated ; the miserable series of my being is wound to its close ! Oh , Frankenstein ! Generous and self - devoted being ! What does it avail that I now ask thee to pardon me ? I , who irretrievably destroyed thee by destroying all thou lovedst . Alas ! He is cold , he can not answer me . ”" "“ Your repentance , ”" "“ is now superfluous . If you had listened to the voice of conscience and heeded the stings of remorse before you had urged your diabolical vengeance to this extremity , Frankenstein would yet have lived . ”" "“ And do you dream ? ”" "“ Do you think that I was then dead to agony and remorse ? He , ”" "“ he suffered not in the consummation of the deed . Oh ! Not the ten - thousandth portion of the anguish that was mine during the lingering detail of its execution . A frightful selfishness hurried me on , while my heart was poisoned with remorse . Think you that the groans of Clerval were music to my ears ? My heart was fashioned to be susceptible of love and sympathy , and when wrenched by misery to vice and hatred , it did not endure the violence of the change without torture such as you can not even imagine ." "“ After the murder of Clerval I returned to Switzerland , heart - broken and overcome . I pitied Frankenstein ; my pity amounted to horror ; I abhorred myself . But when I discovered that he , the author at once of my existence and of its unspeakable torments , dared to hope for happiness , that while he accumulated wretchedness and despair upon me he sought his own enjoyment in feelings and passions from the indulgence of which I was for ever barred , then impotent envy and bitter indignation filled me with an insatiable thirst for vengeance . I recollected my threat and resolved that it should be accomplished . I knew that I was preparing for myself a deadly torture , but I was the slave , not the master , of an impulse which I detested yet could not disobey . Yet when she died ! Nay , then I was not miserable . I had cast off all feeling , subdued all anguish , to riot in the excess of my despair . Evil thenceforth became my good . Urged thus far , I had no choice but to adapt my nature to an element which I had willingly chosen . The completion of my demoniacal design became an insatiable passion . And now it is ended ; there is my last victim ! ”" "“ Wretch ! ”" "“ It is well that you come here to whine over the desolation that you have made . You throw a torch into a pile of buildings , and when they are consumed , you sit among the ruins and lament the fall . Hypocritical fiend ! If he whom you mourn still lived , still would he be the object , again would he become the prey , of your accursed vengeance . It is not pity that you feel ; you lament only because the victim of your malignity is withdrawn from your power . ”" "“ Oh , it is not thus — not thus , ”" "“ Yet such must be the impression conveyed to you by what appears to be the purport of my actions . Yet I seek not a fellow feeling in my misery . No sympathy may I ever find . When I first sought it , it was the love of virtue , the feelings of happiness and affection with which my whole being overflowed , that I wished to be participated . But now that virtue has become to me a shadow , and that happiness and affection are turned into bitter and loathing despair , in what should I seek for sympathy ? I am content to suffer alone while my sufferings shall endure ; when I die , I am well satisfied that abhorrence and opprobrium should load my memory . Once my fancy was soothed with dreams of virtue , of fame , and of enjoyment . Once I falsely hoped to meet with beings who , pardoning my outward form , would love me for the excellent qualities which I was capable of unfolding . I was nourished with high thoughts of honour and devotion . But now crime has degraded me beneath the meanest animal . No guilt , no mischief , no malignity , no misery , can be found comparable to mine . When I run over the frightful catalogue of my sins , I can not believe that I am the same creature whose thoughts were once filled with sublime and transcendent visions of the beauty and the majesty of goodness . But it is even so ; the fallen angel becomes a malignant devil . Yet even that enemy of God and man had friends and associates in his desolation ; I am alone ." "“ You , who call Frankenstein your friend , seem to have a knowledge of my crimes and his misfortunes . But in the detail which he gave you of them he could not sum up the hours and months of misery which I endured wasting in impotent passions . For while I destroyed his hopes , I did not satisfy my own desires . They were for ever ardent and craving ; still I desired love and fellowship , and I was still spurned . Was there no injustice in this ? Am I to be thought the only criminal , when all humankind sinned against me ? Why do you not hate Felix , who drove his friend from his door with contumely ? Why do you not execrate the rustic who sought to destroy the saviour of his child ? Nay , these are virtuous and immaculate beings ! I , the miserable and the abandoned , am an abortion , to be spurned at , and kicked , and trampled on . Even now my blood boils at the recollection of this injustice ." "“ But it is true that I am a wretch . I have murdered the lovely and the helpless ; I have strangled the innocent as they slept and grasped to death his throat who never injured me or any other living thing . I have devoted my creator , the select specimen of all that is worthy of love and admiration among men , to misery ; I have pursued him even to that irremediable ruin . There he lies , white and cold in death . You hate me , but your abhorrence can not equal that with which I regard myself . I look on the hands which executed the deed ; I think on the heart in which the imagination of it was conceived and long for the moment when these hands will meet my eyes , when that imagination will haunt my thoughts no more ." "“ Fear not that I shall be the instrument of future mischief . My work is nearly complete . Neither yours nor any man ’s death is needed to consummate the series of my being and accomplish that which must be done , but it requires my own . Do not think that I shall be slow to perform this sacrifice . I shall quit your vessel on the ice raft which brought me thither and shall seek the most northern extremity of the globe ; I shall collect my funeral pile and consume to ashes this miserable frame , that its remains may afford no light to any curious and unhallowed wretch who would create such another as I have been . I shall die . I shall no longer feel the agonies which now consume me or be the prey of feelings unsatisfied , yet unquenched . He is dead who called me into being ; and when I shall be no more , the very remembrance of us both will speedily vanish . I shall no longer see the sun or stars or feel the winds play on my cheeks . Light , feeling , and sense will pass away ; and in this condition must I find my happiness . Some years ago , when the images which this world affords first opened upon me , when I felt the cheering warmth of summer and heard the rustling of the leaves and the warbling of the birds , and these were all to me , I should have wept to die ; now it is my only consolation . Polluted by crimes and torn by the bitterest remorse , where can I find rest but in death ?" "“ Farewell ! I leave you , and in you the last of humankind whom these eyes will ever behold . Farewell , Frankenstein ! If thou wert yet alive and yet cherished a desire of revenge against me , it would be better satiated in my life than in my destruction . But it was not so ; thou didst seek my extinction , that I might not cause greater wretchedness ; and if yet , in some mode unknown to me , thou hadst not ceased to think and feel , thou wouldst not desire against me a vengeance greater than that which I feel . Blasted as thou wert , my agony was still superior to thine , for the bitter sting of remorse will not cease to rankle in my wounds until death shall close them for ever ." "“ But soon , ”" "“ I shall die , and what I now feel be no longer felt . Soon these burning miseries will be extinct . I shall ascend my funeral pile triumphantly and exult in the agony of the torturing flames . The light of that conflagration will fade away ; my ashes will be swept into the sea by the winds . My spirit will sleep in peace , or if it thinks , it will not surely think thus . Farewell . ”"
Elizabeth: "“ My children , ”" "“ my firmest hopes of future happiness were placed on the prospect of your union . This expectation will now be the consolation of your father . Elizabeth , my love , you must supply my place to my younger children . Alas ! I regret that I am taken from you ; and , happy and beloved as I have been , is it not hard to quit you all ? But these are not thoughts befitting me ; I will endeavour to resign myself cheerfully to death and will indulge a hope of meeting you in another world . ”" "“ My dearest Cousin ," "“ Get well — and return to us . You will find a happy , cheerful home and friends who love you dearly . Your father ’s health is vigorous , and he asks but to see you , but to be assured that you are well ; and not a care will ever cloud his benevolent countenance . How pleased you would be to remark the improvement of our Ernest ! He is now sixteen and full of activity and spirit . He is desirous to be a true Swiss and to enter into foreign service , but we can not part with him , at least until his elder brother returns to us . My uncle is not pleased with the idea of a military career in a distant country , but Ernest never had your powers of application . He looks upon study as an odious fetter ; his time is spent in the open air , climbing the hills or rowing on the lake . I fear that he will become an idler unless we yield the point and permit him to enter on the profession which he has selected ." "“ Justine , you may remember , was a great favourite of yours ; and I recollect you once remarked that if you were in an ill humour , one glance from Justine could dissipate it , for the same reason that Ariosto gives concerning the beauty of Angelica — she looked so frank - hearted and happy . My aunt conceived a great attachment for her , by which she was induced to give her an education superior to that which she had at first intended . This benefit was fully repaid ; Justine was the most grateful little creature in the world : I do not mean that she made any professions I never heard one pass her lips , but you could see by her eyes that she almost adored her protectress . Although her disposition was gay and in many respects inconsiderate , yet she paid the greatest attention to every gesture of my aunt . She thought her the model of all excellence and endeavoured to imitate her phraseology and manners , so that even now she often reminds me of her ." "“ One by one , her brothers and sister died ; and her mother , with the exception of her neglected daughter , was left childless . The conscience of the woman was troubled ; she began to think that the deaths of her favourites was a judgement from heaven to chastise her partiality . She was a Roman Catholic ; and I believe her confessor confirmed the idea which she had conceived . Accordingly , a few months after your departure for Ingolstadt , Justine was called home by her repentant mother . Poor girl ! She wept when she quitted our house ; she was much altered since the death of my aunt ; grief had given softness and a winning mildness to her manners , which had before been remarkable for vivacity . Nor was her residence at her mother ’s house of a nature to restore her gaiety . The poor woman was very vacillating in her repentance . She sometimes begged Justine to forgive her unkindness , but much oftener accused her of having caused the deaths of her brothers and sister . Perpetual fretting at length threw Madame Moritz into a decline , which at first increased her irritability , but she is now at peace for ever . She died on the first approach of cold weather , at the beginning of this last winter . Justine has just returned to us ; and I assure you I love her tenderly . She is very clever and gentle , and extremely pretty ; as I mentioned before , her mien and her expression continually remind me of my dear aunt ." "“ Now , dear Victor , I dare say you wish to be indulged in a little gossip concerning the good people of Geneva . The pretty Miss Mansfield has already received the congratulatory visits on her approaching marriage with a young Englishman , John Melbourne , Esq . Her ugly sister , Manon , married M. Duvillard , the rich banker , last autumn . Your favourite schoolfellow , Louis Manoir , has suffered several misfortunes since the departure of Clerval from Geneva . But he has already recovered his spirits , and is reported to be on the point of marrying a lively pretty Frenchwoman , Madame Tavernier . She is a widow , and much older than Manoir ; but she is very much admired , and a favourite with everybody ." "“ I am , ”" "“ the cousin of the unhappy child who was murdered , or rather his sister , for I was educated by and have lived with his parents ever since and even long before his birth . It may therefore be judged indecent in me to come forward on this occasion , but when I see a fellow creature about to perish through the cowardice of her pretended friends , I wish to be allowed to speak , that I may say what I know of her character . I am well acquainted with the accused . I have lived in the same house with her , at one time for five and at another for nearly two years . During all that period she appeared to me the most amiable and benevolent of human creatures . She nursed Madame Frankenstein , my aunt , in her last illness , with the greatest affection and care and afterwards attended her own mother during a tedious illness , in a manner that excited the admiration of all who knew her , after which she again lived in my uncle ’s house , where she was beloved by all the family . She was warmly attached to the child who is now dead and acted towards him like a most affectionate mother . For my own part , I do not hesitate to say that , notwithstanding all the evidence produced against her , I believe and rely on her perfect innocence . She had no temptation for such an action ; as to the bauble on which the chief proof rests , if she had earnestly desired it , I should have willingly given it to her , so much do I esteem and value her . ”" "“ Yes , ”" "“ I will go , although she is guilty ; and you , Victor , shall accompany me ; I can not go alone . ”" "“ Rise , my poor girl , ”" "“ why do you kneel , if you are innocent ? I am not one of your enemies , I believed you guiltless , notwithstanding every evidence , until I heard that you had yourself declared your guilt . That report , you say , is false ; and be assured , dear Justine , that nothing can shake my confidence in you for a moment , but your own confession . ”" "“ No , Justine , ”" "“ he is more convinced of your innocence than I was , for even when he heard that you had confessed , he did not credit it . ”" "“ I truly thank him . In these last moments I feel the sincerest gratitude towards those who think of me with kindness . How sweet is the affection of others to such a wretch as I am ! It removes more than half my misfortune , and I feel as if I could die in peace now that my innocence is acknowledged by you , dear lady , and your cousin . ”" "“ When I reflect , my dear cousin , ”" "“ on the miserable death of Justine Moritz , I no longer see the world and its works as they before appeared to me . Before , I looked upon the accounts of vice and injustice that I read in books or heard from others as tales of ancient days or imaginary evils ; at least they were remote and more familiar to reason than to the imagination ; but now misery has come home , and men appear to me as monsters thirsting for each other ’s blood . Yet I am certainly unjust . Everybody believed that poor girl to be guilty ; and if she could have committed the crime for which she suffered , assuredly she would have been the most depraved of human creatures . For the sake of a few jewels , to have murdered the son of her benefactor and friend , a child whom she had nursed from its birth , and appeared to love as if it had been her own ! I could not consent to the death of any human being , but certainly I should have thought such a creature unfit to remain in the society of men . But she was innocent . I know , I feel she was innocent ; you are of the same opinion , and that confirms me . Alas ! Victor , when falsehood can look so like the truth , who can assure themselves of certain happiness ? I feel as if I were walking on the edge of a precipice , towards which thousands are crowding and endeavouring to plunge me into the abyss . William and Justine were assassinated , and the murderer escapes ; he walks about the world free , and perhaps respected . But even if I were condemned to suffer on the scaffold for the same crimes , I would not change places with such a wretch . ”" "“ My dearest friend , you must calm yourself . These events have affected me , God knows how deeply ; but I am not so wretched as you are . There is an expression of despair , and sometimes of revenge , in your countenance that makes me tremble . Dear Victor , banish these dark passions . Remember the friends around you , who centre all their hopes in you . Have we lost the power of rendering you happy ? Ah ! While we love , while we are true to each other , here in this land of peace and beauty , your native country , we may reap every tranquil blessing — what can disturb our peace ? ”" "“ Be happy , my dear Victor , ”" "“ there is , I hope , nothing to distress you ; and be assured that if a lively joy is not painted in my face , my heart is contented . Something whispers to me not to depend too much on the prospect that is opened before us , but I will not listen to such a sinister voice . Observe how fast we move along and how the clouds , which sometimes obscure and sometimes rise above the dome of Mont Blanc , render this scene of beauty still more interesting . Look also at the innumerable fish that are swimming in the clear waters , where we can distinguish every pebble that lies at the bottom . What a divine day ! How happy and serene all nature appears ! ”" "“ What is it that agitates you , my dear Victor ? What is it you fear ? ”"
our: "“ Farewell ! ”"
Clerval: "“ old familiar faces , ”" "“ My dear Frankenstein , ”" "“ how glad I am to see you ! How fortunate that you should be here at the very moment of my alighting ! ”" "“ You may easily believe , ”" "“ how great was the difficulty to persuade my father that all necessary knowledge was not comprised in the noble art of book - keeping ; and , indeed , I believe I left him incredulous to the last , for his constant answer to my unwearied entreaties was the same as that of the Dutch schoolmaster in The Vicar of Wakefield : ‘ I have ten thousand florins a year without Greek , I eat heartily without Greek . ’ But his affection for me at length overcame his dislike of learning , and he has permitted me to undertake a voyage of discovery to the land of knowledge . ”" "“ It gives me the greatest delight to see you ; but tell me how you left my father , brothers , and Elizabeth . ”" "“ My dear Victor , ”" "“ what , for God ’s sake , is the matter ? Do not laugh in that manner . How ill you are ! What is the cause of all this ? ”" "“ Is that all , my dear Henry ? How could you suppose that my first thought would not fly towards those dear , dear friends whom I love and who are so deserving of my love ? ”" "“ You have been ill , very ill , and even the constant letters of dear kind Henry are not sufficient to reassure me on your account . You are forbidden to write — to hold a pen ; yet one word from you , dear Victor , is necessary to calm our apprehensions . For a long time I have thought that each post would bring this line , and my persuasions have restrained my uncle from undertaking a journey to Ingolstadt . I have prevented his encountering the inconveniences and perhaps dangers of so long a journey , yet how often have I regretted not being able to perform it myself ! I figure to myself that the task of attending on your sickbed has devolved on some mercenary old nurse , who could never guess your wishes nor minister to them with the care and affection of your poor cousin . Yet that is over now : Clerval writes that indeed you are getting better . I eagerly hope that you will confirm this intelligence soon in your own handwriting ." "“ Little alteration , except the growth of our dear children , has taken place since you left us . The blue lake and snow - clad mountains — they never change ; and I think our placid home and our contented hearts are regulated by the same immutable laws . My trifling occupations take up my time and amuse me , and I am rewarded for any exertions by seeing none but happy , kind faces around me . Since you left us , but one change has taken place in our little household . Do you remember on what occasion Justine Moritz entered our family ? Probably you do not ; I will relate her history , therefore in a few words . Madame Moritz , her mother , was a widow with four children , of whom Justine was the third . This girl had always been the favourite of her father , but through a strange perversity , her mother could not endure her , and after the death of M. Moritz , treated her very ill . My aunt observed this , and when Justine was twelve years of age , prevailed on her mother to allow her to live at our house . The republican institutions of our country have produced simpler and happier manners than those which prevail in the great monarchies that surround it . Hence there is less distinction between the several classes of its inhabitants ; and the lower orders , being neither so poor nor so despised , their manners are more refined and moral . A servant in Geneva does not mean the same thing as a servant in France and England . Justine , thus received in our family , learned the duties of a servant , a condition which , in our fortunate country , does not include the idea of ignorance and a sacrifice of the dignity of a human being ." "“ When my dearest aunt died every one was too much occupied in their own grief to notice poor Justine , who had attended her during her illness with the most anxious affection . Poor Justine was very ill ; but other trials were reserved for her ." "“ I must say also a few words to you , my dear cousin , of little darling William . I wish you could see him ; he is very tall of his age , with sweet laughing blue eyes , dark eyelashes , and curling hair . When he smiles , two little dimples appear on each cheek , which are rosy with health . He has already had one or two little _ wives , _ but Louisa Biron is his favourite , a pretty little girl of five years of age ." "“ My dear Victor ," "“ You have probably waited impatiently for a letter to fix the date of your return to us ; and I was at first tempted to write only a few lines , merely mentioning the day on which I should expect you . But that would be a cruel kindness , and I dare not do it . What would be your surprise , my son , when you expected a happy and glad welcome , to behold , on the contrary , tears and wretchedness ? And how , Victor , can I relate our misfortune ? Absence can not have rendered you callous to our joys and griefs ; and how shall I inflict pain on my long absent son ? I wish to prepare you for the woeful news , but I know it is impossible ; even now your eye skims over the page to seek the words which are to convey to you the horrible tidings ." "“ William is dead!—that sweet child , whose smiles delighted and warmed my heart , who was so gentle , yet so gay ! Victor , he is murdered !" "“ I will not attempt to console you ; but will simply relate the circumstances of the transaction ." "“ Last Thursday ( May 7th ) , I , my niece , and your two brothers , went to walk in Plainpalais . The evening was warm and serene , and we prolonged our walk farther than usual . It was already dusk before we thought of returning ; and then we discovered that William and Ernest , who had gone on before , were not to be found . We accordingly rested on a seat until they should return . Presently Ernest came , and enquired if we had seen his brother ; he said , that he had been playing with him , that William had run away to hide himself , and that he vainly sought for him , and afterwards waited for a long time , but that he did not return ." "“ This account rather alarmed us , and we continued to search for him until night fell , when Elizabeth conjectured that he might have returned to the house . He was not there . We returned again , with torches ; for I could not rest , when I thought that my sweet boy had lost himself , and was exposed to all the damps and dews of night ; Elizabeth also suffered extreme anguish . About five in the morning I discovered my lovely boy , whom the night before I had seen blooming and active in health , stretched on the grass livid and motionless ; the print of the murder ’s finger was on his neck ." "“ He was conveyed home , and the anguish that was visible in my countenance betrayed the secret to Elizabeth . She was very earnest to see the corpse . At first I attempted to prevent her but she persisted , and entering the room where it lay , hastily examined the neck of the victim , and clasping her hands exclaimed , ‘ O God ! I have murdered my darling child ! ’" "“ She fainted , and was restored with extreme difficulty . When she again lived , it was only to weep and sigh . She told me , that that same evening William had teased her to let him wear a very valuable miniature that she possessed of your mother . This picture is gone , and was doubtless the temptation which urged the murderer to the deed . We have no trace of him at present , although our exertions to discover him are unremitted ; but they will not restore my beloved William !" "“ Come , dearest Victor ; you alone can console Elizabeth . She weeps continually , and accuses herself unjustly as the cause of his death ; her words pierce my heart . We are all unhappy ; but will not that be an additional motive for you , my son , to return and be our comforter ? Your dear mother ! Alas , Victor ! I now say , Thank God she did not live to witness the cruel , miserable death of her youngest darling !" "“ Come , Victor ; not brooding thoughts of vengeance against the assassin , but with feelings of peace and gentleness , that will heal , instead of festering , the wounds of our minds . Enter the house of mourning , my friend , but with kindness and affection for those who love you , and not with hatred for your enemies ." "“ Your affectionate and afflicted father ," "“ Alphonse Frankenstein ." "“ Geneva , May 12th , 17—. ”" "“ My dear Frankenstein , ”" "“ are you always to be unhappy ? My dear friend , what has happened ? ”" "“ I can offer you no consolation , my friend , ”" "“ your disaster is irreparable . What do you intend to do ? ”" "“ To go instantly to Geneva : come with me , Henry , to order the horses . ”" "“ Poor William ! ”" "“ dear lovely child , he now sleeps with his angel mother ! Who that had seen him bright and joyous in his young beauty , but must weep over his untimely loss ! To die so miserably ; to feel the murderer ’s grasp ! How much more a murdered that could destroy radiant innocence ! Poor little fellow ! one only consolation have we ; his friends mourn and weep , but he is at rest . The pang is over , his sufferings are at an end for ever . A sod covers his gentle form , and he knows no pain . He can no longer be a subject for pity ; we must reserve that for his miserable survivors . ”" "“ This is what it is to live , ”" "“ now I enjoy existence ! But you , my dear Frankenstein , wherefore are you desponding and sorrowful ! ”" "“ I have seen , ”" "“ the most beautiful scenes of my own country ; I have visited the lakes of Lucerne and Uri , where the snowy mountains descend almost perpendicularly to the water , casting black and impenetrable shades , which would cause a gloomy and mournful appearance were it not for the most verdant islands that relieve the eye by their gay appearance ; I have seen this lake agitated by a tempest , when the wind tore up whirlwinds of water and gave you an idea of what the water - spout must be on the great ocean ; and the waves dash with fury the base of the mountain , where the priest and his mistress were overwhelmed by an avalanche and where their dying voices are still said to be heard amid the pauses of the nightly wind ; I have seen the mountains of La Valais , and the Pays de Vaud ; but this country , Victor , pleases me more than all those wonders . The mountains of Switzerland are more majestic and strange , but there is a charm in the banks of this divine river that I never before saw equalled . Look at that castle which overhangs yon precipice ; and that also on the island , almost concealed amongst the foliage of those lovely trees ; and now that group of labourers coming from among their vines ; and that village half hid in the recess of the mountain . Oh , surely the spirit that inhabits and guards this place has a soul more in harmony with man than those who pile the glacier or retire to the inaccessible peaks of the mountains of our own country . ”" "“ I could pass my life here , ”" "“ and among these mountains I should scarcely regret Switzerland and the Rhine . ”" "“ I had rather be with you , ”" "“ in your solitary rambles , than with these Scotch people , whom I do not know ; hasten , then , my dear friend , to return , that I may again feel myself somewhat at home , which I can not do in your absence . ”"
the professor: "“ Have you , ”" "“ really spent your time in studying such nonsense ? ”"
M. Krempe: "“ every instant that you have wasted on those books is utterly and entirely lost . You have burdened your memory with exploded systems and useless names . Good God ! In what desert land have you lived , where no one was kind enough to inform you that these fancies which you have so greedily imbibed are a thousand years old and as musty as they are ancient ? I little expected , in this enlightened and scientific age , to find a disciple of Albertus Magnus and Paracelsus . My dear sir , you must begin your studies entirely anew . ”" "“ These were men to whose indefatigable zeal modern philosophers were indebted for most of the foundations of their knowledge . They had left to us , as an easier task , to give new names and arrange in connected classifications the facts which they in a great degree had been the instruments of bringing to light . The labours of men of genius , however erroneously directed , scarcely ever fail in ultimately turning to the solid advantage of mankind . ”"
This professor: "“ The ancient teachers of this science , ”" "“ promised impossibilities and performed nothing . The modern masters promise very little ; they know that metals can not be transmuted and that the elixir of life is a chimera but these philosophers , whose hands seem only made to dabble in dirt , and their eyes to pore over the microscope or crucible , have indeed performed miracles . They penetrate into the recesses of nature and show how she works in her hiding - places . They ascend into the heavens ; they have discovered how the blood circulates , and the nature of the air we breathe . They have acquired new and almost unlimited powers ; they can command the thunders of heaven , mimic the earthquake , and even mock the invisible world with its own shadows . ”"
M. Waldman: "“ I am happy , ”" "“ to have gained a disciple ; and if your application equals your ability , I have no doubt of your success . Chemistry is that branch of natural philosophy in which the greatest improvements have been and may be made ; it is on that account that I have made it my peculiar study ; but at the same time , I have not neglected the other branches of science . A man would make but a very sorry chemist if he attended to that department of human knowledge alone . If your wish is to become really a man of science and not merely a petty experimentalist , I should advise you to apply to every branch of natural philosophy , including mathematics . ”" "“ D — n the fellow ! ”" "“ why , M. Clerval , I assure you he has outstript us all . Ay , stare if you please ; but it is nevertheless true . A youngster who , but a few years ago , believed in Cornelius Agrippa as firmly as in the gospel , has now set himself at the head of the university ; and if he is not soon pulled down , we shall all be out of countenance.—Ay , ay , ”" "“ M. Frankenstein is modest ; an excellent quality in a young man . Young men should be diffident of themselves , you know , M. Clerval : I was myself when young ; but that wears out in a very short time . ”"
Coleridge: "“ Ancient Mariner . ”"
Ernest: "“ Welcome , my dearest Victor , ”" "“ Ah ! I wish you had come three months ago , and then you would have found us all joyous and delighted . You come to us now to share a misery which nothing can alleviate ; yet your presence will , I hope , revive our father , who seems sinking under his misfortune ; and your persuasions will induce poor Elizabeth to cease her vain and tormenting self - accusations.—Poor William ! he was our darling and our pride ! ”" "“ She most of all , ”" "“ requires consolation ; she accused herself of having caused the death of my brother , and that made her very wretched . But since the murderer has been discovered — ”" "“ Good God , papa ! Victor says that he knows who was the murderer of poor William . ”" "“ My dear father , you are mistaken ; Justine is innocent . ”"
Justine: "“ Your arrival , my dear cousin , ”" "“ fills me with hope . You perhaps will find some means to justify my poor guiltless Justine . Alas ! who is safe , if she be convicted of crime ? I rely on her innocence as certainly as I do upon my own . Our misfortune is doubly hard to us ; we have not only lost that lovely darling boy , but this poor girl , whom I sincerely love , is to be torn away by even a worse fate . If she is condemned , I never shall know joy more . But she will not , I am sure she will not ; and then I shall be happy again , even after the sad death of my little William . ”" "“ God knows , ”" "“ how entirely I am innocent . But I do not pretend that my protestations should acquit me ; I rest my innocence on a plain and simple explanation of the facts which have been adduced against me , and I hope the character I have always borne will incline my judges to a favourable interpretation where any circumstance appears doubtful or suspicious . ”" "“ Alas ! ”" "“ How shall I ever again believe in human goodness ? Justine , whom I loved and esteemed as my sister , how could she put on those smiles of innocence only to betray ? Her mild eyes seemed incapable of any severity or guile , and yet she has committed a murder . ”" "“ Oh , Justine ! ”" "“ Why did you rob me of my last consolation ? I relied on your innocence , and although I was then very wretched , I was not so miserable as I am now . ”" "“ And do you also believe that I am so very , very wicked ? Do you also join with my enemies to crush me , to condemn me as a murderer ? ”" "“ I did confess , but I confessed a lie . I confessed , that I might obtain absolution ; but now that falsehood lies heavier at my heart than all my other sins . The God of heaven forgive me ! Ever since I was condemned , my confessor has besieged me ; he threatened and menaced , until I almost began to think that I was the monster that he said I was . He threatened excommunication and hell fire in my last moments if I continued obdurate . Dear lady , I had none to support me ; all looked on me as a wretch doomed to ignominy and perdition . What could I do ? In an evil hour I subscribed to a lie ; and now only am I truly miserable . ”" "“ Oh , Justine ! Forgive me for having for one moment distrusted you . Why did you confess ? But do not mourn , dear girl . Do not fear . I will proclaim , I will prove your innocence . I will melt the stony hearts of your enemies by my tears and prayers . You shall not die ! You , my playfellow , my companion , my sister , perish on the scaffold ! No ! No ! I never could survive so horrible a misfortune . ”" "“ I do not fear to die , ”" "“ that pang is past . God raises my weakness and gives me courage to endure the worst . I leave a sad and bitter world ; and if you remember me and think of me as of one unjustly condemned , I am resigned to the fate awaiting me . Learn from me , dear lady , to submit in patience to the will of heaven ! ”" "“ Dear sir , you are very kind to visit me ; you , I hope , do not believe that I am guilty ? ”" "“ I wish , ”" "“ that I were to die with you ; I can not live in this world of misery . ”" "“ Farewell , sweet lady , dearest Elizabeth , my beloved and only friend ; may heaven , in its bounty , bless and preserve you ; may this be the last misfortune that you will ever suffer ! Live , and be happy , and make others so . ”"
Alas: "“ The expression of your sentiments of this subject , my dear Victor , gives me more pleasure than I have for some time experienced . If you feel thus , we shall assuredly be happy , however present events may cast a gloom over us . But it is this gloom which appears to have taken so strong a hold of your mind that I wish to dissipate . Tell me , therefore , whether you object to an immediate solemnisation of the marriage . We have been unfortunate , and recent events have drawn us from that everyday tranquillity befitting my years and infirmities . You are younger ; yet I do not suppose , possessed as you are of a competent fortune , that an early marriage would at all interfere with any future plans of honour and utility that you may have formed . Do not suppose , however , that I wish to dictate happiness to you or that a delay on your part would cause me any serious uneasiness . Interpret my words with candour and answer me , I conjure you , with confidence and sincerity . ”"
him: "“ very poetry of nature . ”" "“ Are you mad , my friend ? ”" "“ Or whither does your senseless curiosity lead you ? Would you also create for yourself and the world a demoniacal enemy ? Peace , peace ! Learn my miseries and do not seek to increase your own . ”"
