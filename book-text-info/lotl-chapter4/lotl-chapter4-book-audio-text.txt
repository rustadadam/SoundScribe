Out of the Ashes
Chapter Four






















Sibier’s hair bristled as he listened to the nearby vagrants. 
</his> “Look at that slithering soldier eating in our faces just to mock us,” the vagrant complained to his partner, his resentment tainting the air. Siber sniffed, squinting against the blistering wind that whipped in from the ocean. His stomach rumbled, twisting in hunger, but unable to consume the knot of hatred that boiled in him. Skies, he had lost everything. 
Ilyian — his four-year-old brother — tugged at Sibier’s shirt, letting out a low whine. Ilyian’s dark hair was matted like Sibier’s, but his face was softer and rounder: evidence of the food Sibier had always shared with him. 
Ilyian’s bright-green eyes looked up at him longingly as he tugged. Sibier sighed, leaning back slightly to let his younger brother climb onto his lap. Not everything was lost, he thought, as he wrapped an arm protectively around Ilyian.
With sharp blue eyes, Sibier stared at the soldier, his face hardening against the blistering wind. Ocean spray pelted his skin, giving him a dangerous, glistening appearance. His thick black hair, usually kept short, was now rugged, with wet strands whipping against his cheeks. His bones were visible beneath his skin, and his veins rippled with every movement. He was lucky enough to have more food than some. 
Fingering a shard of broken glass in his back pocket, Sibier wondered how the grain the soldier held would taste. His hand tightened around the edge of the glass as Ilyian pressed his face against Sibier’s chest, whining softly. Heavens above, they needed food… and he wanted revenge.
For all nineteen years of his life, the Kingdom had mocked, abused, and terrorized Sibier. Before, he had taken it with his chin held high, smiling unfazed as his parents had taught him. But now, with his parents gone, all he wanted was to make the Kingdom pay.
Save our dreams, echoed the haunting voice of his father. Sibier clenched his fist, taking a deep breath. He would, but he would also make the Kingdom hurt for what they did to him. 
Leaning forward, Sibier listened to the two vagrants huddled behind a rock, sheltering themselves from the ocean’s buffets. The taller companion spat on the ground, his broad build making the motion awkward and almost pitiful. He likely had once been a soldier; a peculiarity in times when warriors were scarce and even odder now when they were so essential. In today’s Kingdom, almost anyone would do anything for a meal, and being part of the policing force was one way to do so. Sibier bit his lip; he hated that. They all did.
The larger vagrant turned to his smaller companion, easily dwarfing the older man. His features sagged, and cuts crisscrossed his face as though a bird had decided to draw on it with its talons. </the bigger vagrant> “We should fight him, Terit,” the bigger vagrant muttered gruffly. </the bigger vagrant> “Take our food back.”
Sibier smirked, echoing the deep-rooted bitterness inside of him. These men are desperate, he realized. It had been men like them a few weeks ago who had started the mob on Earl’s Road and embarrassed the king’s forces. It had been men like them who had voiced the unrest of the people. And it was men like them that Sibier needed.
Gently setting Ilyian by a rock beside him, Sibier bit his lip. Time and time again, his father’s last words whispered in his mind, as though the man never left him. Save yourself. Save Ilyian. Save our dreams, his father had asked. Their family had tried to do just that for years, and finally Sibier had little left to lose and that made him reckless. 
Pausing, he took a deep breath, and gazed up to the stars. </Sibier> “I will,” he promised softly. </Sibier> “I will do it, Father.” The stars seemed to twinkle back at him, as if acknowledging his vow. Yet, he hoped the stars didn’t see deep enough to see his other, darker desires. 
Nearby, Terit, the scrawny vagrant, spat out a mouthful of blood-tinged sand. </Terit> “It’s pointless, Yorin,” he muttered, his voice heavy with defeat. </Terit> “We either starve or die at the tip of his sword.” The despair in Terit's sagging eyes reflected his malnourished form, slumped in resignation as his tongue continued to roll more sand around in his mouth.
Sibier watched them closely, a fire kindling within him. The echoes of his father’s legacy, the plea to save their dreams, resonated in his mind. This could be the start, he thought. This could be the beginning of fulfilling my promise.
He pulled Ilyian into a tight hug, feeling his brother’s fragile breath against his neck, a small warmth against the biting cold and howling wind. Whispering to him, Sibier’s words reflected the consuming worry that gnawed at him. </Ilyian> “Do you think we’ll survive this?”
        Ilyian pulled back, his wide eyes brimming with distress. The boy hadn’t eaten in nearly two days, and his eyes were red from crying. </Ilyian> “Where’s Ma?”
Those words, spoken by the innocence of his brother, tore through Sibier. His lips quivered as he struggled to hold back his tears and he clenched his fists, anger and sorrow intertwining in his heart.How could this have happened? Skies, It wasn’t fair. The injustice of it all burned within him. After a lifetime of fighting to build something, to honor his family’s legacy, everything had been ripped away. The kingdom had taken it all, leaving him with nothing but a seething, bitter rage.
Sibier’s eyes narrowed as he glared at the distant figure of the captain of the seventh district. Men like him had heckled Sibier throughout his childhood for his family’s broken name. Now, they had finally taken everything. But I will not let them take our dreams, he vowed silently. Not while I still breathe. 
The salty wind stung his cuts as he confronted the bitter truth—there was no refuge, no sanctuary for them. There was nowhere to run where food would abound, where his parents would live again, and where safety would embrace him.
Biting his lips, Sibier’s fist tightened around the shard of glass in his pocket, his eyes locking onto the captain. He needed food. He needed to save his family’s dream. He needed vengeance. 
Turning to the vagrants, Sibier set his jaw. </I> “I’ll get you both some food.” 
Yorin narrowed his eyes and Terit scoffed. </Terit> “What are you going to do kid?”
Sibier didn’t answer, as he leapt over the sheltering rock, letting Terit’s words become lost in the howling wind as he headed straight for the captain. Two fish lay on a tray beside him, as the man spooned soppy grain into his mouth. Half of it was pushed to the side, giving the impression he was saving it for later… skies, even this soldier was eating rations.
        But it was too late now to turn back. This is it, Sibier realized. This is where I start. He looked heavenwards, whispering a prayer in his heart. His mind raced, doubts about his plan swirling like a storm. 
        Sibier could almost feel the vagrants watching him from behind, likely placing bets on how long it took before he had a blade in his gut. Yet, he saw Ilyian out of the corner of his eyes, poking nearby moss and laughing as the plant puffed its fumes. He gave a half-hearted chuckle. With Ilyian’s innocence propelling him, he stomped up to the guard, stopping mere inches away — close enough to smell the man’s sweat. The uniform’s colors were faded from years of use, although his blade was well polished, branded with the king’s insignia of a crow;  this man wasn’t merely a soldier — he was a captain.
Sibier bit his lip. A captain was on rations? He felt a chill crawl down his spine. This is suicide. 
Burying his fear deep within him, Sibier raised his chin, staring straight into the captain’s eyes. </Sibier> “Your name, sir?”
The captain allowed a smug smile to tug at the corner of his lips. He spooned more grain into his mouth, speaking through a mouthful of food. </He> “Go your way.”
Sibier’s throat went dry, but he refused to show it. </Sibier> “I asked for your name, not a retort,” he repeated, his voice steady. His father’s final words echoed in his mind, infusing him with courage. Even so, his legs trembled, goosebumps running down his skin. Breathe.
        </He> “It is Captain Werrin to you not sir,” the captain barked, his amusement giving way to irritation. </He> “Do not disrespect me again.”
The words cut through Sibier like a dagger, but he managed a faint smile, tilting his head slightly. His hands shook in his pocket, yet he kept his voice firm. </Sibier> “Give me your food, Sir Werrin, and I will be happy to leave.”
Werrin abruptly stood up, roughly pushing Sibier away. </Werrin> “You get my scraps, urchin.”
Heart pounding in his chest, Sibier stepped forward, acting on instinct. Adrenaline pulsed through his veins, memories of his parents burning bright in his mind. Save our dreams. Each move felt guided by the stars, and he felt as though courage had been poured upon him from above. 
Sibier got close, close enough to smell Werrin’s breath. </Sibier> “That mess back on Earl’s Road,” he threatened, fists clenched tight. </Sibier> “You wouldn’t want reports trickling in that you were in charge, do you? That you were the one who let the riot unfold, the one who failed to strike down three derelicts?”
Werrin cursed, his hand going to the pommel of his sword. Sibier didn’t flinch. </Sibier> “You better leave me alone, urchin.” 
Sibier cocked his head, noticing the discomfort in Werrin’s eyes. </Sibier> “You kill me here and you’ll look even more like the culprit,” Sibier chuckled, forcing bravado into his words. </Sibier> “I have friends watching right now who’d be happy to testify they saw you on Earl’s Road. I don’t think any of them would mind being promoted to captain…”
        Werrin’s face paled. </Werrin> “You’re bluffing.”
        Sibier shrugged, though sweat began to bead on his forehead. </Sibier> “Then call my bluff,” he challenged, </Sibier> “or just give me your food, and I’ll be on my way”. 
Werrin’s fingers tightened around the handle of his sword, his eyes narrowing into small slits. Sibier’s heart froze in his chest. I went too far. Skies, I went too far! 
        Sir Werrin stared at Sibier, his face unreadable as the silence stretched between them like a taut rope ready to snap. He could hear the blood pounding in his ears, the tension sticky in the air. Time seemed to drag on for eternity, and Sibier had to fight off the urge to run. Every instinct clawed at him to flee. 
Finally, Werrin took his hand off his sword, sighing. </Werrin> “I could use more men like you,” he whispered. He sat down, spooning more grain into his mouth. </Werrin> “But your threat is a lie, kid.” 
Sibier sniffed, at a loss for words. He felt ready to throw up, and his stomach growled loudly. After another bite, Werrin smirked and pushed the tray towards Sibier. </Werrin> “Here.” He wiped his mouth and stood up. </Werrin> “Be back here tomorrow at first light, and I’ll bring your enlistment papers to sign. You won’t have to worry about starving any more.”
Sibier blinked, bewildered. He took the tray, saying nothing. 
</Werrin> “What was your name, kid?”
</Werrin> “Sibier.”
</Sibier> “And your last?”
Sibier hesitated: every kingdom officer knew his last name, and they all hated him for it. He could lie, but he knew he wouldn’t. He wouldn’t forget his family’s legacy.  </Sibier> “It's Sogni, captain,” he answered. 
Sir Werrin paused, his eyes narrowing. When he spoke again, his tone was a little more brittle. </Werrin> “I had heard that the High Executioner had finally visited the last of the Sogni.”
Sibier tensed, the fresh sting of memories flooding his mind. He could still hear his parents' screams, feel the paralyzing chill of fear in his bones. They had been his world, and now they were gone—ripped away by the merciless kingdom. By the High Executioner. By Trent, the rebellion leader. The bile of hatred rose in his throat as he swallowed hard. How could he even consider joining the kingdom’s guards? What would his parents think?
Werrin leaned forward, clearly interested now. </Werrin> “How did you escape?”
Thoughts raced through his mind, as Sibier scrambled to come up with a believable lie. If he knew I had escaped, would he turn me in? With his heart pounding in his chest, Sibier answered quickly. </Sibier> “I didn’t hear about that. It’s not my name by birth — I adopted it when David Sogni saved the rebellion.”
Werrin inspected Sibier, speaking slowly. </Werrin> “I was there,” he paused, reflective. </Werrin> “David lost his closest friend that day. In his sorrow, he became a tempest of rage, and he had that same look in his eyes that you do.” The captain smirked. </He> “David never fought again after that. It broke him.”
Sibier bit his lip, fighting back the tears in his eyes. This was not the time! But this story was close to his heart. He knew it well.
 Werrin continued to watch him, and after a few seconds, he seemed satisfied. </Werrin> “Welcome to the team, Sibier.” 
Sibier nodded, picking up the tray, hiding the cacophony of emotions inside. </Sibier> “I’ll see you tomorrow.” He wasn’t sure if he meant those words.
With his hands full, Sibier strode back to the vagrants, their jaws agape. They looked at each other with complete astonishment, neither saying a word. 
Ripping off a small piece of one of the fish, Sibier handed the fragment to Ilyian, who was enthusiastically clapping his hands. Heavens above, he thought, everything is good to that kid! He tossed the remaining fish to the vagrants, sitting down next to them and picked up the spoon. 
        </My> “My name is Yorin,” the burly one said slowly, stupefied he was holding food. His eyes were wide, and he took a cautious bite.
</My> “Terit,” the other mumbled, unbelieving. </My> “My name is Terit.”
        Sibier smiled, feeling hope rekindled in his heart. He lifted Ilyian, slinging him triumphantly over his shoulder, and finished off the meal. It hadn’t been much, but it was something. </Sibier> “My name is Sibier Sogni,”  he smiled. </Sibier> “And I believe we can create something where none of us will go hungry again.¨
Yorin and Terit exchanged glances, their brows raised. “He is the one the stars would send…” Yorin whispered reverently, only for Terit to interrupt.
¨You can get us more food?” Terit asked, his tone sharp with skepticism.
Sibier shrugged, shifting Ilyian onto his hip. </Terit> “Maybe,” he paused, feeling the weight of his words. </Sibier> “I have a dream for this kingdom. Do you want to be a part of it?” 
He heard Yorin clamber to his feet, Terit’s curses following. </Sibier> “The one blessed by the stars…” Yorin started, his voice tinged with awe. </Yorin> “Who are you?”
Terit rolled his eyes. </Yorin> “Yorin spent too much time in jail reading from those dilapidated words,” — </Terit> “scriptures,” Yorin interjected, but Terit ignored him — </Yorin> “anyways, he’s a little gone up here,” he said, tapping his head. </Terit> “To the depths with it all though, because we’re in… but what's the plan, kid?”
Ilyian plopped the chunk of fish into his mouth, then promptly hugged Sibier. Together, they laughed.
