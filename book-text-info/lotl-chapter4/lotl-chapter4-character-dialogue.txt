the vagrant: “ Look at that slithering soldier eating in our faces just to mock us , ” | 
the bigger vagrant: “ We should fight him , Terit , ” | 
Sibier: “ Take our food back . ” |  “ I will , ” |  “ I will do it , Father . ” |  “ It ’s pointless , Yorin , ” |  “ We either starve or die at the tip of his sword . ” |  “ Do you think we ’ll survive this ? ” |  “ I ’ll get you both some food . ” |  “ I asked for your name , not a retort , ” |  “ Give me your food , Sir Werrin , and I will be happy to leave . ” |  “ You get my scraps , urchin . ” |  “ That mess back on Earl ’s Road , ” |  “ You would n’t want reports trickling in that you were in charge , do you ? That you were the one who let the riot unfold , the one who failed to strike down three derelicts ? ” |  “ You better leave me alone , urchin . ” |  “ You kill me here and you ’ll look even more like the culprit , ” |  “ I have friends watching right now who ’d be happy to testify they saw you on Earl ’s Road . I do n’t think any of them would mind being promoted to captain … ” |  “ You ’re bluffing . ” |  “ Then call my bluff , ” |  “ or just give me your food , and I ’ll be on my way ” |  “ I could use more men like you , ” |  “ But your threat is a lie , kid . ” |  “ Here . ” |  “ Be back here tomorrow at first light , and I ’ll bring your enlistment papers to sign . You wo n’t have to worry about starving any more . ” |  “ What was your name , kid ? ” |  “ Sibier . ” |  “ And your last ? ” |  “ It 's Sogni , captain , ” |  “ I had heard that the High Executioner had finally visited the last of the Sogni . ” |  “ I did n’t hear about that . It ’s not my name by birth — I adopted it when David Sogni saved the rebellion . ” |  “ I was there , ” |  “ David never fought again after that . It broke him . ” |  “ Welcome to the team , Sibier . ” |  “ I ’ll see you tomorrow . ” |  “ My name is Terit . ” |  “ My name is Sibier Sogni , ” |  “ And I believe we can create something where none of us will go hungry again.¨ Yorin and Terit exchanged glances , their brows raised . “ | 
His: “ Where ’s Ma ? ” | 
Yorin: “ What are you going to do kid ? ” |  “ The one blessed by the stars … ” |  “ Who are you ? ” |  “ scriptures , ” | 
He: “ Your name , sir ? ” |  “ Go your way . ” |  “ It is Captain Werrin to you not sir , ” |  “ Do not disrespect me again . ” |  “ David lost his closest friend that day . In his sorrow , he became a tempest of rage , and he had that same look in his eyes that you do . ” | 
Werrin: “ How did you escape ? ” | 
My: “ My name is Yorin , ” | 
the other: “ Terit , ” | 
Terit: ” Yorin whispered reverently , only for Terit to interrupt . ¨You can get us more food ? ” |  “ Maybe , ” |  “ I have a dream for this kingdom . Do you want to be a part of it ? ” |  “ Yorin spent too much time in jail reading from those dilapidated words , ” |  “ anyways , he ’s a little gone up here , ” |  “ To the depths with it all though , because we ’re in … but what 's the plan , kid ? ” |
