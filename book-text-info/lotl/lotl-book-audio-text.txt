The Conqueror
Chapter One
























Trent [b]knocked th[c]e King Icar’s blade out of his hands.
His chest heaved as he raised his sword, the tip quivering just inches from Icar’s throat. A slow, bitter smile tugged at the corners of Trent's lips, the taste of iron sharp in his mouth—a reminder of the necessary brutality that had brought him to this moment.
Trent had finally won.
The air was thick with sweat as Trent felt the weight of an entire kingdom’s suffering lift off his shoulders. This rebellion—this final battle—was the culmination of sacrifice, tears and grit, fueled by a broken people. The kingdom's hunger, the wails of orphaned children, the terror of the Trials… all of it would end with the pulse trembling under the point of his sword.
</Sibier> “It’s over,” Trent growled, his voice low, rough like stone grinding against steel. His grip tightened on the hilt of his sword, and the blade inched closer to Icar’s throat, just enough to draw the first pinprick of blood.
But Icar—gaunt, pale, with eyes sunken into his skull—didn’t flinch. He didn’t beg. He didn’t even look afraid. Instead, his thin lips curled into something that might have been a smile, or maybe something even darker. His calm, almost amused gaze sent a chill rippling through Trent's veins.
Why was he smiling?
Trent's pulse quickened. His instincts screamed at him that something was wrong, but he couldn’t let it show. Not now. He was the rebellion leader, the man who had risen from nothing to topple a tyrant. He had led hundreds to their deaths for this moment. He had sworn to see the king dead. He had to see the king dead. Skies, I should be the one smiling!
Trent dug the blade a fraction deeper, a thin line of blood dripping down Icar’s throat.
 </Sibier> “Is that it?” Trent roared, shaking. </Sibier> “You have nothing to say? No last words, no plea for mercy?” His hand trembled, despite himself.
But King Icar's smile only grew. Slowly, as if savoring each word, he wrapped his bony fingers around the edge of Trent’s sword and pulled it closer to his chest, the blade cutting into his own skin. His eyes never left Trent’s. </Icar> “My life doesn’t end here, Trent,” he said, his voice steady, cold. </Icar> “You and I both know that. The stars have a far greater destiny for me.” 
A shudder chilled Trent's spine. He could feel Icar’s eyes digging into him, searching for something deep inside, but he didn’t dare let his blade waver.
 </Sibier> “You’re a liar,” Trent spat.
</I> “And you’re naive, Trent,” the King continued, his voice low and dangerous. </I> “You know barely anything. You’re more concerned about a few lives than the course of history itself. The suffering you’re so eager to end—it's nothing compared to what’s coming.”
Trent’s knuckles whitened around the hilt of his sword. He wasn’t going to let the king play mind games, not now. Not when they were this close to victory.
</Sibier> “You don’t know what you’re talking about,” Trent hissed.
Icar’s lips twitched into a smirk, his eyes gleaming with something like pity. </Icar> “I know far more than you,” he said softly. </Icar> “And I know this: with me, Trent, you could save not just a few lives, but you could save the kingdom.”
 Clenching his teeth, Trent took a step closer, masking the gnawing fear inside. </Sibier> “I’ll save the kingdom by killing you.”
King Icar leaned in, his voice dipping into a whisper that chilled Trent to his core. </Icar> "And let your family [d]die?”
The words hit him like a hammer. Trent’s heart stopped. He tried to keep the fear from his face, but Icar’s eyes were sharp. They saw everything.
Heavens above.
The tip of Trent's sword quivered inches from the king's chest, mirroring the tremors of doubt that shuddered through him. His grip tightened around the hilt, cracking his dry skin. How could he have reached my family?
For a moment, Trent closed his eyes, trying to block out the fear. He could almost see his family, hearing their voices as if they were right in front of him. His mother’s strong scent of olive oil when he embraced her goodbye. Sasha, his oldest sister, with her steady smile and reassuring voice as she ruffled his hair before he left for this final mission. And Selean—his youngest sister—fiery, rebellious Selean, pumping her fist in the air, practically begging him to take her along. He had laughed it off, telling her that they were safer in the rebellion base where the king could never find them…
Trent felt as though he had been suckerpunched.
Trent swallowed hard, shaking his head as if to physically throw off the doubt. He had been so careful, hadn’t he? He had hidden them, secured them. They were supposed to be safe. But Icar’s calm, his eerie confidence—it gnawed at Trent’s resolve, twisted it, made him question everything he thought he knew. How could the king be so blasted sure?
Behind him, the clang of steel and muffled cries echoed off the stone walls. Karia. She was still fighting, a whirlwind of motion and fire, her auburn hair wild and streaked with blood as she wrenched her dagger from a fallen guard’s throat. Her eyes, fierce and alive, darted around for any remaining threats.
</Karia> "Hurry, Trent." Karia’s voice cut through the fog in his mind like a blade, sharp and urgent. </Sibier> "Finish it."
But Trent’s hands shook. He could feel the sword’s weight in his grip, could see its gleaming edge, but it no longer felt like a weapon of justice. It felt like a burden—heavy, mocking—its point pressed against the throat of a man who had somehow turned everything upside down in a matter of minutes. His family weighed heavily on his mind. Could I sacrifice them?
Trent had dreamed of this moment, prayed for it, bled for it. For years, he and Karia had built this rebellion, imagining the day when they would finally bring down the tyrant king. Yet now, with the moment at hand, Trent felt paralyzed. Was it all worth it? Had they done any of it right?
Rage bubbled beneath the surface, mingling with his terror. He hated Icar—hated him for the hunger, the fear, the endless Trials that had torn families apart. But now he was terrified too—terrified that Icar wasn’t bluffing. That with one fatal mistake, he might condemn his own family to the very suffering he had fought so hard to escape.
</Sibier> "Prove it," Trent demanded, his voice barely more than a whisper, cracked and raw. His arms shook with the effort to stay his hand, every muscle tight, every nerve screaming for release.
But Icar, with the serenity of a serpent coiled and ready to strike, only smiled wider, saying nothing.
Trent snapped.
With a savage thrust, he drove his knee into Icar’s stomach. The fragile king bent forwards gasping, his skeletal frame folding under the force. Before Icar could catch his breath, Trent backhanded him, sending the king’s head whipping to the side. </Icar> “PROVE IT!” Trent screamed, his voice hoarse with fury, his chest heaving with wild, frantic breaths. His hands twitched, trembling as though they could barely contain his need to rip Icar apart.
But even beaten and sprawled on the cold stone floor, the king’s eerie grin remained. </Icar> “Your family…” Icar rasped, blood flecking his lips. </Sibier> “They were collected as tribute for the Trials.” His voice was strained, but there was a twisted satisfaction behind his words, every syllable dripping with cruelty. </Sibier> “I still remember how your sister Selean kicked and screamed. Her spark of hope is… resilient. She might go far before she dies.”
Trent froze, his world tilting on its axis. </Sibier> “No,” he whispered, his voice breaking, barely audible over the hammering of his heart. </I> “No… how?” His mind reeled, stumbling over itself. He couldn’t believe it, didn’t want to believe it, but his gut twisted as though it was the truth.
</I> “There isn’t much time before the Trial begins,” the tyrant continued, wiping blood from his chin.  </Sibier> “I already started the process.”
Trent’s grip loosened on his sword. His hand fell, limp and useless, and the weapon clattered to the floor with a metallic crash. The weight of Icar’s words settled over Trent, crushing him under its brutal reality. His legs buckled, the strength sapped from his body. </Sibier> “No…” he muttered, shaking his head like a man drowning, trying to surface for air. </Sibier> “No, no, no!” 
His mind unraveled, memories flooding in, relentless and agonizing. He remembered the nights spent planning with Karia, both of them shivering under threadbare blankets, clinging to hope. He remembered passing orphaned children on the streets, flicking them a coin with a wink that promised salvation. He remembered his friend’s dying breath on the battlefield, the life draining from his eyes as Trent held him, helpless. Was it all for nothing? The thought tore through him like a jagged blade. Was this all for naught? The price… his family… I can’t…
Then the images shifted: his mother’s tear-streaked face as she clung to him, grieving the loss of his brother, dead from cholera. He had begged the king’s doctors for medicine, but he had only gotten spit. That day he had sworn to tear the monarchy apart piece by bloody piece, to avenge every slight, every loss. Everything Trent had ever done was for his family. Everything. 
And now? Now they were the ones paying the price.
Something inside him broke free, a wild, seething fury rising like molten lava. Trent’s entire body trembled, his fists clenching so tight his nails dug into his palms. His vision blurred, red creeping in at the edges. Blast it all! That tyrant isn’t going to kill any more of them! 
Roaring, Trent surged forward, fists raised, ready to crush Icar under the weight of his wrath. </Icar> “TO THE DEPTHS WITH YOU!”
        But as Trent moved to strike, Icar pushed himself to his knees. Blood trickled down his face, but his eyes were as calculating as ever. </Icar> “You’ll need me,” Icar rasped, barely audible over the pounding in Trent’s ears. </Karia> “To save them, Trent. Only I know where the Trials are.”
Trent stopped mid-lunge, his fists hovering in the air. He could feel the heat of his own rage, but something paralyzingly cold seized his heart. Selean. Sasha. He could see them now, their terrified faces, their wide, pleading eyes. He could hear their voices calling his name, begging for him to save them.
His fists lowered, shaking with the effort. Trent’s breath came in ragged gasps. He could feel Icar’s eyes on him. If I kill him… I kill them too.
        </Karia> “Trent, they’re coming,” Karia warned, her arms shaking as she recovered her blade. Even her resilience, which had always been unshakable, now appeared fragile. Her eyes—wild with fear—darted to Trent, pleading without words.
Trent’s stomach churned violently, nausea rising in his throat. Every step that brought him to this moment had been paved with sacrifice—for the rebellion, for the kingdom, for hope—but at its core, hadn’t it always been about one thing? The warmth of home, the laughter of his family, their arms around him. Everything he did, every ounce of blood he spilled, was to bring that dream back. It never had been for the kingdom. It had always been about his family.
        But now, that dream was shattered. I lost, didn’t I?
        He could feel it. The fire that once blazed within him, the rebellion that had fueled him for so long—it was extinguished. What was left wasn’t courage or determination. It was ashes. Cold, dead ashes.
        </Karia> “TRENT!” Karia screamed. </Sibier> “WHAT ARE YOU WAITING FOR!” The ring of clashing steel cut through the air as Karia fought off the first wave of guards. More were coming, and fast.
        Torn, tears dripped down Trent’s cheeks. </Icar> “I… I…” he choked. What am I doing? His hands fell to his side. His choices pulled him in both directions, ripping him apart, leaving his mind fractured. 
        Smug, Icar extended his sleeved arm with his hand outstretched. It felt cold.  </Icar> “Join me, Trent,” he offered, his tone like ice sliding over Trent’s skin, </Sibier> “and together we will save so much more than just your family.”
        Trent looked up… then down again. His eyes were wide and tear-streaked, as he swallowed, his voice dry. </Karia> “I… I… I can’t. Karia, I’m sorry.” His voice cracked as he forced the bitter words out, barely able to stand the weight of them.
        Heavens above, Trent pleaded, forgive me. Around him, the world seemed to slow, each heartbeat a solemn drumbeat in his ears. His fingers shook violently as they inched toward Icar’s hand, like a man reaching out in a storm, grasping for something—anything—to hold onto. They hovered just above the king’s chilled, crow-like fingers.
Karia’s voice broke through again, filled with disbelief. </Sibier> “What are you doing, Trent?!” She was still fighting, still holding on, still trying to believe in him. The sound of her sword clashing against the guards only deepened his guilt, but he couldn’t bring himself to look at her.
Trent took a deep breath, his voice shaking as he tried to convince himself. </Sibier> “Karia,” he repeated, his lips trembling and voice tiny. </Karia> “I… I… I have to do it. I’m sorry.”
His hand closed over Icar’s.
Karia's reaction was a tempest unleashed. She twisted out of the way of an attacker’s sloppy thrust, her body flowing with the grace of someone used to fighting against impossible odds. Her hand found the hilt of her knife, and in one smooth, practiced motion, she hurled it. It rocketed through the air, a lethal promise headed straight for Icar's heart.
But Trent, frozen by a terrible premonition, saw the future painted in bloody strokes—he saw himself huddled over the corpses of his family.  Not like this,  his mind screamed. It can't end like this!
Time slowed, each second stretching out in painful clarity. Karia’s eyes widened in shock as Trent launched himself between her blade and the king. He could see the disbelief on her face, and could almost hear the silent scream forming on her lips.
Then the blade struck.
It sank deep into his abdomen, and the world jolted back into motion. The impact slammed him against the cold stone floor, the breath stolen from his lungs even as the knife drained the life from him. A sound escaped him—raw, broken, somewhere between a gasp and a scream.
Biting back tears and gasping for breath, Trent cursed. It wasn’t just the pain of the wound tearing him apart. It was the knowledge of what he had done—who he had betrayed. The weight of it crushed him, pressing against his chest until the sobs broke free, uncontrollable.
Struggling, Trent forced himself onto his elbows, his vision blurring. He turned his head toward Karia. She stood there, frozen, her mouth open in a soundless gasp. Her eyes were wide with disbelief, tears already spilling from them. She blinked, once, twice, trying to make sense of the impossible.
Her gaze was locked on Trent and her knife embedded in him. She barely noticed the attack to raise her sword in time, deflecting it with a weak, distracted parry. Another strike came, and she stumbled backward, her feet unsteady. </Karia> "Why, Trent?" she cried, her voice cracking. </Karia> “Why!"
        Her words hit Trent harder than the blade ever could.
        Tears filled Karia’s eyes as her defense crumbled against the guard. Another blow came. She barely dodged. </Skies> “Why, Trent? I trusted you!” she sobbed, shattered. </Sibier> “I… I loved you! Why did you betray me?”
        Skies, I loved you too, but he was too weak to speak the words. He collapsed back on his knees, unable to stand. His vision was beginning to spin.
        Trent’s hand wrapped around the hilt of the knife, fingers trembling. He gave it a weak tug, but the blade stayed firm, buried deep in his flesh. Sweat beaded on his forehead and nausea overcame him. I’m dying. He took another shallow breath. I’m dying. He planted a bloodied hand on the floor, ready to yield to the encroaching darkness. I’m dying.
His fight was over. 
He looked up at Karia, his heart breaking all over again as he watched her falter under the weight of it all, her sword slipping in her hand, her movements sluggish as grief consumed her. I did this to her.
Mustering what little strength he had left, Trent gasped, his voice weak and broken. </Sibier> “Leave, Karia. Run.” Blood dribbled from his lips, his other hand slipping, barely able to hold him upright. </Sibier> “Save yourself.”
Karia hesitated, torn between the battle raging around her and the man she loved. Her face was a storm of emotions—pain, betrayal, rage, love—all crashing into each other, leaving her paralyzed for a moment too long.
</Karia> “Go!” Trent forced the word out, coughing as more blood spilled from his mouth. He wasn’t going to make it. He knew that now. But she… she could still survive. She could still live. Save her. Save her from me.
Everything spun, as colors became grays and grays became darkness. Trent's eyes drifted shut as his breath slowed, surrendering to an unexpected calm. A stillness came over him… this was it. Was this what it felt like to die?
        </Karia> “No,” Karia’s begging tone pierced the consuming haze. </Karia> “No, please…” Her words shattered the serenity, pulling at the fraying edges of his consciousness.
The chaos of the battle, the sting of betrayal, even the searing pain in his abdomen—all of it began to fade into the background, becoming distant echoes. In this void, Trent felt something unexpected: relief. He knew he would make the same choice again. He would die here, but his family would survive.
That thought anchored him, kept him from falling apart. And yet…
Karia’s sword clattered to the ground.
        Then, her arms wrapped around him, pulling him into her warmth. Her tears soaked into his bloodied chest as she clung to him like he was the last piece of her shattered world. Trent felt her desperation in every tremor of her body, in every stifled sob. He coughed, tasting blood, but also tasting something else—regret.
        I can’t leave her! Even the sharp pain in his stomach faded away, but Trent still felt Karia’s breath. I can’t leave her…
He felt her quiet sobs, her pleas like prayers. </Karia> “You idiot, Trent.” She pulled him tight, tears dribbling down her cheeks. </Karia> “Please don’t leave me!” 
Trent blinked, pushing away the darkness momentarily and saw Karia, the love of his life. Suddenly, he felt suffocated by his decision. He had chosen a path that ripped apart everything they had built, everything they had dreamed of. He had broken her trust. His heart ached not from the blade but from the pain he had caused her.
But there was no going back now.
Gritting his teeth, Trent drew in a shaky breath, every ounce of strength left in him poured into one final act. He wrapped his trembling arms around Karia, pulling her close in a desperate, final act of repentance.
He did love her.
His fate had come. It was time for the unbeatable rebellion leader to die. It was time for the Kingdom’s hope to die. He took a deep breath. It was time for Trent to die.
 Tears streamed down Karia’s face, her sobs wracking her body. </Karia> “Don’t go,” she begged, her voice breaking. </Sibier> “Please don’t go...”
Trent’s eyes, once a bastion of resolve, grew heavy as he finally surrendered to his end. </Sibier> “I’m sorry,” he breathed. </Skies> “I loved you.” 
Karia whimpered, her grip tightening as if she could hold him back from death itself.
But Trent was already slipping away.
His arms went limp.
His breath stilled.
And it was all over.

Reduced to Legacy
Chapter Two
























</Sibier> “Brother[e]?”
        Awakened by the noise, Trent squinted his crusted eyes, overwhelmed by pain. His stomach throbbed, trying to make sense of the darkness encompassing him. Skies, he cursed. Am I dreaming? Or is this some kind of cruel illusion?
Shifting, Trent winced as pain shot through him, a harsh reminder of reality. His fingers brushed against rough bandages, igniting flashes of memory – Karia's embrace, the cold floor, his betrayal.
Trent's thoughts swirled in a maelstrom of guilt and loss, each memory of Karia a sharp sting of what might have been. A silent scream echoed within him, a cry for the rebellion that had crumbled to dust. His pulse didn't quicken in panic but sank in a slow, heavy rhythm of defeat, the weight of his failure pressing down like a physical force.
But then Trent froze, a dark thought seizing him. Where was Karia? He felt as though his gut had been stuffed down his throat. Without seeing anything, his eyes darted around, frantic. He felt his heart hammer in his chest, a drumbeat of anxiety. 
        </Sibier> “Brother?” It came clearer this time, sharp and urgent, shaking him out of his spiraling worry.
Trent’s eyes snapped open: he knew that voice. </Sibier> “Sasha? Is that you?” His voice was raspy, dry and strained. Desperate, he strained his eyes against the dim light, yearning for a glimpse of a familiar silhouette. Pain flared with each movement, but it paled against the need to confirm the reality of his sister's presence. Tenderly, he crawled towards the noise, pleading to be able to hear it again. Despite his gnawing wound and drained strength, Trent pushed forward. My family! Trent sniffed, tears in his eyes. My family is alive! 
Maybe, just maybe, he had made the right choice in that blasted throne room.
</I> “Can you not see me?” Sasha's voice trembled with worry. Oh, Sasha! Trent rejoiced. She was always replete with compassion, and he could always count on her to be by her side. 
Shakily, Trent pushed himself upright, his vision a whirlpool of colors that gradually coalesced into discernible shapes – and then, miraculously, into the faces of his family. There they stood, in the dimly lit cave, just outside his cell: his mother and father and his beloved sisters Sasha and Selean.
And King Icar.
He stood behind them all with his arms folded. He appeared as an amused spectator at a zoo.
Ignoring the tyrant, Trent staggered towards the cell’s bars. Stretching his arms through them, he reached for Sasha with a desperation that eclipsed his hunger for freedom. Her eyes were wide and brimming with tears as she clasped his hand. </I> “We are here, brother. All of us,” she comforted, her voice a soothing whisper.
        </Sibier> “I know,” Trent answered, tenderly overjoyed. </Selean> “I know.”
In that moment, as Trent gazed upon his family, the gnawing guilt that had clung to his soul began to dissolve. Deep inside his soul he knew that for his family, he would brave anything because they were his everything. A gentle peace, warm and soothing, seeped through the cracks of his battered heart, dispelling the icy scars of fear and regret. The familiarity of his family brought a new warmth. He noticed how his father's brow bunched together, revealing a smile of chipped teeth, the rosy flush of his mother's cheeks, or the way Selean's nose crinkled in uncertainty. Oh, the simple, profound joy of seeing them once more!
Yet, even as this joy swelled within him, it cast a long shadow over the hidden chambers of his heart, veiling the sadness that lay buried underneath. Trent felt it: the silent echo of his betrayal to the kingdom, to his friends, and worst of all, to Karia. He pushed those thoughts away, focusing on the light coming from his family. Yet, his heart still pulsed with a sorrowful rhythm, a reminder of the cost of his survival. The price of this bittersweet reunion had not been cheap.
        </Trent ’s mother> “You should have done it,” Selean, Trent’s younger sister—seventeen and spotted with freckles—muttered. Her green eyes flickered up to Trent before darting back to the ground. Trent’s mother forcibly nudged her, her words quick and scolding. </Trent ’s mother> “Don’t you see his pain?” she chided quietly. </her> “Don’t add to it.”
        Trent began to feel sick, and his happiness felt a little bit more hollow. His guilt had not gone away, and now it was eating at his joy. More than ever, King Icar’s presence weighed down heavily in the prison corridor. Trent’s focus wandered over to the King, as he felt his guilt feed a boiling rage. Where was Karia? If he had killed her… Trent swallowed. If the blasted King killed her then Trent would personally escort him to the depths. 
        Unfazed by Trent’s glare, Icar raised his chin, inspecting. Why is he here? Couldn’t the blasted idiot leave me alone? Didn’t he already win! Darker thoughts stormed through Trent’s mind like a whirlwind. His chest began to rise up and down as he fumed. I need to get my hands on his scrawny neck…
Sasha squeezed his hand, gently tugging him away from his anger. With one word, she dispelled his rage. </Sibier> “Trent.”
Trent's breath hitched, then slowly steadied as he locked eyes with Sasha. There was an unspoken understanding in her gaze, contrasting his inner turmoil. Even disheveled, her hair fell loosely around her shoulders, there was an air of composure about her that Trent had always envied but relied upon. 
Releasing Sasha's hand, Trent gently grasped her shoulders, searching her eyes for the truth. </Icar> "Are you safe?" he asked, his voice low and urgent.
Sasha's response was a silent nod, her lips parting as if to speak a different truth, but no sound came. Instead, Icar’s voice filled the void. </Sibier> “They are under my protection, Trent. As long as I am under yours.”
Trent's nod was slow, heavy with the weight of realization and reluctant acceptance. He detested the thought of serving Icar, yet his family's safety eclipsed all other concerns. He had no other option. </Selean> "Then so be it," he muttered through clenched teeth, the words tasting like ash in his mouth.
</Their mother> "Brother, no!" Selean cried out, her call a mix of heroic courage and teenage stupidity. Their mother sternly elbowed her, yet her expression mirrored Selean’s distress. </Sibier> "It is not your choice to make, Selean." Seeing his family defeated, Trent felt his heart skip a beat. If my family had been in my place, would they have made the same choice I did? 
He felt his heart sink. What if my family would have preferred to be dead for the kingdom to taste freedom? Did they even want to keep living like this? Living like puppets underneath the King? 
Trent's arms fell limply to his sides, the energy draining from him as a cold realization washed over his mind. The fire of the rebellion leader, once a roaring blaze within him, was barely a mere flicker, smothered under the weight of his new, unwanted role. He was a pawn in a game he had never wanted to play. 
        </Sibier> “The kingdom?” Trent inquired, seeking to find any spark of hope. </Sibier> “How are they?”
His father frowned. </She> “What do you expect? It's over.”
        Trent felt as though he had been punched in the gut, but Sasha was quick to give a faint smile. Oh, how I love my sister! She was always one to uplift, thank the skies. </She> “It’s not your fault, brother. You gave it your best.”
        </She> “I’m sorry,” he whispered, feeling the cold grasp of defeat. </Sibier> “The cost was too great for me to pay.”
        </She> “Trent, it’s okay,” Sasha comforted, peering into Trent’s haunted eyes. She noticed the conflict within him. </Sibier> “It’s alright.”
Tears blurred Trent's vision as he pulled Sasha close, the cruel bars of his cell a stark reminder of their incomplete reunion. They stood as a physical divide, yet symbolized so much more—the chasm between his current reality and the life he yearned for with his family. I wish I could be on the other side of these bars. I wish I could be free with my family, Trent fantasized. But hadn’t that been the purpose behind the whole rebellion? Now that dream has vanished.
Why did I betray everyone? Why couldn’t I have just ended Icar’s life? Like ghouls, the questions haunted him, threatening to numb his emotions and leave him bereft of warmth.
And then there was Karia. The mere thought of her name brought a fresh surge of tears, a painful reminder of another bond severed by his choices, another person he had left behind in his pursuit of a greater good that now seemed so elusive. The bars, cold and unyielding, stood as a testament to his failures, a barrier not just to his freedom, but to the redemption he so desperately sought. Where was Karia now? 
 </Sibier> “How are the people?” he asked weakly. </I> “How are they handling… handling…” His voice trailed off, the words too heavy, too bitter to fully form. They tasted like tar, and when they reluctantly spilled from his lips, they seemed to tear apart something vital from within him. </I> “How are they handling that I betrayed them?”
His father scoffed. </Sibier> “You shattered the last flicker of hope they had, Trent. Might as well have thrown your lot in with the Darkened Dawn.” With that, Trent felt a tremor in his heart. Skies, did Father always have to be so pessimistic?
His father wasn’t finished yet. He glanced down, biting his lip, and muttered under his breath, </I> “We all believed in you…. All of us.” Trent could sense his father’s deep-rooted sorrow. Even worse, his father’s pain began to echo in the chambers of Trent’s soul. 
Sasha's voice, in contrast, was a gentle balm, though her words carried no less gravity. </I> “The kingdom believes you to be dead, Trent. They've lost hope—all of it,” she said softly. Her eyes, brimming with a sad understanding, sought to meet his.
</Sibier> "The kingdom thinks I'm dead?" Trent's voice was barely above a whisper, each word laced with disbelief. He was more than a symbol: he was their protector, their voice against oppression, their hope! And now, in the eyes of his people, he had become a mere memory soon to be forgotten.
His shoulders slumped in defeat. Everyone has lost their hope, Trent realized. The truth tormented him: he had failed the kingdom, and because of his surrender, there would be no more heroes to carry on their flame of hope. It was extinguished. He wondered if he could ever be truly happy again.
He wished Karia’s knife had killed him after all.
As he reflected upon his years in the Rebellion, his thoughts no longer filled him with hope but dread. With a cruel twist, past warcries, mottos, and mantras tormented him, as their words—once motivational—now jeered him. Feeling his gut wrench deep inside of him, he mumbled a phrase he had once brazenly chanted so many times: </Sibier> “You are only defeated once you surrender your hope…”
We are defeated then, aren’t we?
Searching for relief, Trent met his sister’s eyes and once again found kindness kindled in them. He felt any hate inside of him flake away, crumbling to dust. In Sasha, Trent found the courage to push on for just a little bit longer, and to ask the hideous question that lurked deep inside of him. Like a clawing monster, it gnawed its way to the forefront of his mind, consuming all other thoughts. But this time, he didn’t push the question away—he confronted it. </Selean> “Where’s Karia?”
Skies, the question terrified him. His mouth dried.
The atmosphere shifted palpably at his question. It was as though an ominous cloud had descended upon them, casting shadowed veils over their faces, darkening their expressions with an unspoken dread. Sasha's fingers tightened around his hand, a gesture of solace in the face of the unspeakable. Her eyes, brimming with unshed tears, were pools of sorrow.
Trent felt as though his own pulse had gone quiet. The silence was deafening, their avoidance a cacophony of alarm bells in his mind. Why aren’t they saying anything? The question seared through him, a wildfire of panic. He struggled to swallow the lump forming in his throat, the possibility he dreaded most surfacing like a specter in his thoughts. Had they killed her? The mere thought was a blade twisting in his gut, an unbearable notion that threatened to overwhelm him. Skies, I shouldn’t have asked the question! 
His family, just like him, had woven Karia into the very fabric of their lives. She was more than just Trent's second-in-command; she was a fixture in their collective heart. The void her absence left was palpable, a silent ache that resonated within each of them. They had all secretly harbored hopes of welcoming her into their fold, not just as a friend, but as family. Yet, that dream had been cruelly snatched away, leaving a void where once there was the promise of unity and warmth.
Selean, always bold and impulsive, set her jaw, turned and glared at Icar. </Sibier> “We don’t know because this idiot won’t tell us,” Selean spat, her defiance testament of the depth of her love for Karia.
Trent's eyes narrowed, his focus shifting to the king. He scrutinized Icar, searching for a crack in the monarch's facade, a glimpse into the thoughts behind that inscrutable expression. The quiet that stretched between them was thick with unvoiced questions and accusations. It was clear now why his family had been reticent; they were waiting, just as he was, for the tyrant to break his silence.
King Icar’s response was nothing more than a smirk, a simple curve of his lips. It was a look that mocked their pain, a silent, scornful dismissal of their concern. That smirk was a clear message: he held the cards, he controlled the game.
Trent was the one to fold. Anger boiled within him as the temperature rose. </I> “Did you kill her?” he snarled, through gritted teeth. All eyes in the room turned to the King. It would have made any other person uncomfortable, but the monarch stepped into it, his chin held high. 
Calmly, the king folded his arms, his answer shocking. </Icar> “I understand how you all see me as the villain—your greatest enemy,” he gave a wide grin. Trent wished he could punch those teeth in: the tyrant is my greatest enemy. 
Icar continued. </Icar> “And I may be, but I am not evil. No, I didn’t kill your girlfriend,” he mocked. </Sibier> “I saved her.”
Not letting the surprise catch him off guard, Trent’s response was quick-witted. </Icar> “Explain,” he demanded, his voice a low growl. The sardonic edge to Icar’s words reminded Trent of the enigma of the Trials: no one knew what went on there, but everyone knew that no one ever returned. Could he have taken Karia to the Trials? A shiver ran down his spine.
Icar signaled to his guards with a dismissive gesture, his expression inscrutable. </Icar> "Take his family to their room, and leave us," he ordered. </Selean> "I have matters to discuss with Trent, in private."
Charged with unspoken questions and fears, the room crackled with tension as Selean stood her ground. As the guards advanced, Selean shoved one aside, quickly grabbing one of the bars separating her from Trent. </Icar> “I won’t leave my brother,” she hissed. 
Trent felt a surge of pride for her sister. She is so brave… and stupid. The thought gave him a faint smile.
But King Icar was not amused. </Sibier> “Now,” he commanded, a sharp edge in his voice brooking no argument. A guard slapped Selean with callous disregard, roughly grabbing her arms and forcibly shoving them behind her back. 
The hair on Trent’s arms stood up: no one treated his sisters like that. No one treated Selean like that. </I> “Treat my family with respect!” He yelled, shaking with emotion, nearly breaching insanity. To the depths with the king!
King Icar eyed the guard, waiting to see his response. When the soldier did not comply with Trent’s plea, Icar smirked. The blasted fool knows he has all the control. Instinctively, Trent reached for his sword, but his hand brushed air. 
Yet, surprisingly, Icar sided with Trent. </the guard> “Do as he requests; we are not barbarians,” the King reprimanded.
</the guard> “Apologies, my King,” the guard said, yet under his breath, he grumbled, </I> “These scum don’t deserve respect.”
        Once again, the King shocked Trent. </I> “I do not want to hear you speak again today, Guard. You would learn well to appreciate the strength of your enemies. Now go.”
One by one, Trent’s family left the room, as no one dared to say anything that could snap the palpable tension in the room. On her way out, Trent’s mother squeezed his shoulder passionately. </Sibier> “We will see each other again. I promise.”
</Sibier> “We will,” Trent confirmed, quivering with determination. </Sibier> “Nothing will stand between us.” He would make sure of it. He had to.
With a soft puff, the door shut behind the guards and his family, leaving the room feeling empty. Trent felt as though his heart had gone out the door with them. The moment with his family had been so fleeting, and he craved their calming reassurance again. Now, all he felt was a smoldering pile of regret and a growing fear. Where was Karia?
Bold like an arrow, Trent stared straight at Icar. </I> “What do you mean you saved her?” He accused, his words filled with venom.
        </Icar> “She is alive in prison and her wounds were treated,” the King stated matter-of-factly. Trent felt a sense of relief breathe into his soul, yet he refused to trust him… or believe him. Icar always had a deeper motivation. What was it this time?
Rubbing his chin, Icar paced in front of Trent’s cell. </Icar> “With me, you will never have to worry about the safety and care of Karia or your family. Be assured that your family will be well: they will have the best rooms, the best food, the best security — everything that our kingdom has left to offer.”
Trent narrowed his eyes. What is it that he wants? 
Icar continued. </Icar> “Just like you need me, I need you, Trent. I need you to help me save more than just your family. I need you to help me save the people of the Kingdom! So let us help each other, shall we?”
Glaring at the king, Trent disrespectfully sat down. Grimacing, his hands instinctively went to the bandages around his abdomen—the pain was still fresh. </Sibier> “There is nothing you can show me to prove that you are actually interested in saving my people. You won’t fool me with your lies.”
King Icar frowned. </Sibier> “You don’t understand. Rebels never do. You see yourself as so righteous, so virtuous, and so honorable as you claim to fight for a better future. That's not what others see. I see fraud. I see unfulfilled promises. I see unnecessary fighting, pain, war. Death. And all of it under the false banner of hope.”
Trent spat, disgusted. </Icar> “If you would only lower your tithes we wouldn't have to fight. You suppress the people underneath your heel: they cannot survive like that! Don’t you dare tell me that you don’t see all the starving children in the streets. They would have money to buy food without your incessant tithes!”
</Icar> “And we as a kingdom cannot survive without those tithes,” Icar snapped, veins popping. </Sibier> “How can you be blind enough not to see the truth? No one here lives in decadence! We are under threat by the Heti, and our only option is appraisal by giving them their demanded tribute. That is how we all survive, Trent. Not how you survive.” The king's rage, no longer veiled, filled the room with a palpable tension, matched only by the intensity in Trent's eyes.
</Sibier> “Then why do you eat three meals a day?” Trent countered. </Icar> “No one else in this kingdom has that privilege.”
</Sibier> “The Darkened Dawn does,” Icar rebuffed sharply, his voice laced with irritation. </Sibier> “And you are quick to assume, you ingrate. Rarely do I have that privilege.”
Trent scoffed, disbelief etched on his face. </Icar> “You’re a liar. Why don’t you just wipe out the Darkened Dawn?”
</Icar> “They follow their own laws, and they have slipped outside of my grasp,” Icar fumed, his fists clenched in frustration. </Sibier> “That's precisely why I need you. I need a seasoned war leader like you to defeat them!”
        </Sibier> “No,” Trent answered firmly. </Icar> “No, I won’t help you.” He had already betrayed the kingdom once, and heavens above, he wasn’t going to again. He would do this for Karia. He could do this for her. For the person who always stood by him. 
        Icar threw his hands up in the air, exasperated. </Sibier> “Why are you so blasted stubborn?” He shook his head, clenching the glow stone tighter in his palm and it cracked it his hands. His tone was a low growl like a lion. </Sibier> “The seas are losing their fish. Our fields are underproducing. And our enemies raise their tribute each year. Soon there will be no food, leaving us with no choice but to risk our lives to harvest seaweed.”
        </Sibier> “Then forgo your demonic Trials,” Trent roared. </Sibier> “Stop wasting all of our resources to kill our own people!” The room echoed as silence followed, giving the king’s words time to sink deep. He paused. Wait, who are they paying tribute too? The Heti?
        </Icar> “What—” Trent started, but Icar cut him off.  </Sibier> “Those Trials are our future. They are our only way to beat the blasted Heti! How shortsighted you are not to understand!”
Trent stood, and brought his face inches away from the King’s. He could smell the mint on his breath. </Icar> “Who are these blasted Heti?” he hissed.
Incensed, Icar’s grip tightened around the glow-stone until it shattered. The room was abruptly enveloped in an eerie darkness, amplifying the tension. His voice, now a venomous snarl, cut through the gloom. </Sibier> “Are you serious? Your single-minded crusade against my throne blinded you to the true state of our world. How can you be so wilfully ignorant?”
Trent's response came as a low, dangerous growl, his patience frayed to its limits. </Sibier> “Enough,” he declared, his voice echoing off the stone walls, filled with a mix of rage and desperation. </Sibier> “Take me back to my family.”
 </Sibier> “You help me, and I guarantee their safety. You don’t make any demands. Understand?” The threat weighed heavily on Trent.
Fuming, Trent took a deep breath. Then in a torrent of anger, he punched the stone, his breath falling in cascades of rage. His dark hair — matted with sweat — swept over his right eye as he glared at the tyrant. </Icar> “If anything happens to my family, Icar, I will put a sword to your throat. Their safety better be guaranteed, heavens above.”
</Icar> “Don’t be a fool, Trent,” King Icar reprimanded, having regained his composure. </Sibier> “We can both get what we want: your family can be safe, and I get your help. Easy.”
        </Icar> “I saved your life!” Trent snarled, raw with emotion. 
        </Icar> “And I saved your family’s lives,” Icar pointed out. </Icar> “You owe their lives thrice over.”
</Icar> “I hate you.”
        </Sibier> “I know.”
        Narrowing his eyes, Trent scowled at Icar. He waited, his breath heavy, almost daring the king to threaten him. Yet, the King’s frown remained steady, as the standoff drew out. Minutes passed in tense silence. Finally, Trent’s resistance crumbled. He hated the words he tentatively spoke next, but he had no other choice. Icar had backed him into a corner. </Icar> “What would you have me do?” he whispered, defeated.
</Icar> “Since you murdered my High Executioner, a position has unexpectedly opened,” Icar said, his grin wide and unsettling. </Sibier> “You will take his place.”
Trent felt as if the ground had vanished beneath him. This is not peace. He knew the whispered rumors: it was said that the High Executioner was the only one that could accompany the king to run the Trials. There was no position of greater secrecy, trust, and… brutality. Trent shivered, remembering how the High Executioner had licked his lips as they fought. He remembered looking into the High Executioner’s eyes and seeing only twisted darkness. The night of the rebellion, Trent hadn’t killed a man, but a monster. How could I ever become that?
Trent swallowed, feeling the weight of his decision. He was cornered, bound by his vow to safeguard his family. He would not, could not fail them. Not now, not ever. Heavens above.
Yet, thoughts of Karia swirled in his mind. She would vehemently oppose this. She would have found a way to break free and strangle the scheming tyrant. But how could I do that? Trent was shackled by circumstance, and Icar held the keys to his family's well-being. He bit his lip, a silent vow to endure, to persist. I have to. For my family. 
With a heavy heart, he uttered, </Sibier> “So be it.”
He would become the High Executioner.

The High Executioner
Chapter Three






















Hide in the darkness, Trent[f] whispered to himself. 
The hood of Trent’s cloak provided a meager refuge from prying eyes. He slipped through the throng, his gaze flitting from face to face, each a potential threat to his concealed identity. Guilt marred his features, as he ducked from view, hoping to keep his secret. His hand, almost unconsciously, brushed against his face, tracing lines of worry etched deep within.
He recoiled from a starving orphan who approached him and trembled as he remembered his past: a few days ago, Trent would have offered stolen bread from the guards. Now, he could barely muster a glance as his eyes, heavy with remorse, fixed firmly on the ground. </Sibier> "They think I'm gone," he muttered to the shadows, </Sibier> "Maybe it's better to be a ghost than a monster in their eyes."
Those words echoed harrowingly in his soul. 
Each step served as a painful reminder of his physical and emotional scars. The alleyways, littered with starving beggars and broken hope, mirrored the chaos within him. Some of them, pushed to lunacy by hunger, even dared to reach over the cliffs of the island, hoping to harvest moss to eat. Trent looked away. They wouldn’t be able to reach the underbelly of the island without falling into the ocean thousands of feet below. 
Moving past those for whom he had once fought, Trent gripped his wounded side, feeling the fabric of his uniform chafe against the unhealed wound. He squinted, but the pain was a mere echo compared to the turmoil that roiled in his heart – a heart torn between duty and despair, yearning for redemption in a world that believed him dead. 
Trent had failed this kingdom. He had failed these people. Distraught, he squeezed his wound, desperate to feel something besides the crippling guilt. Skies, I would rather be dead than live like this.
But what other choice did he have?
Crossing over a bridge connecting two floating islands, Trent hunkered down, feeling gusts of wind whip his coat. Water sprayed from the tumultuous sea thousands of feet below, drenching his clothes. Beside him, more vagrants huddled, conserving their warmth against the bitter weather. This time, he didn’t even give them a second glance.
I should do something for them… but that wish trailed off. This is how it is now, he told himself, struggling to suppress his beliefs. You can’t change it. You can only learn to accept it. But like a magnet, his thoughts gravitated back to Karia. She wouldn’t accept surrender. She would keep fighting. She would find a way. 
A small smile tugged on Trent’s lips as he remembered her steely resolution. He clenched his fist as ideas began to turn in his head. Maybe there was still a way out…
Like the cold wind, a breeze of darkness and despair threatened to put out his flame of hope — It seemed like the more he tried, the more people died. In the end, the rebellion he had led only brought unnecessary death. 
Trent’s shoulders slumped as he blinked away tears. The image of his brother wheezing blackened sludge came to mind. Forget it. You can live easier that way. 
Briskly turning the corner, Trent glanced away from the crying children. They clawed at his soaked trench coat, begging for food. He couldn’t bear to meet their pleading eyes, yet he wouldn’t kick their frostbitten fingers away. Before he had been able to give them hope… today, he could only give them chilled ignorance. He hit his stomach again. 
Focus.
Leaving the children behind to freeze in the torrential gusts, Trent couldn’t lose the budding sourness in his mouth. That was the only thing he could taste anymore; it was the only thing he could feel. Carefully drawing his knife, he grimaced as he cut into his side, reopening his wound. Don’t think. Just do.
        The pain could only distract him for so long. 
Stepping into an eddy of swirling muck, Trent paused, his breathing heavy. Was that laughter? His heart fluttered. 
It was.
Gliding across washed stone, Trent's steps gained urgency, a rhythm of desperation that defied the norm in a kingdom paralyzed by exhaustion and hunger. Eyes followed him, weary citizens lifting their gazes with a mix of curiosity and judgment; in this realm, no one ran without being pursued, especially when the wind threatened sudden storms and the Darkened Dawn lurked watching in the shadows.
Yet, Trent had abandoned all rationale. Clambering up cracked steps, Trent paused on the doorstep, straining his ear. Termites infested the wood, their chittering a constant background noise. But the tunes of melodious laughter and chatter warmed the air behind the door. Peering through the gathering fog, Trent glanced at the rusting numbers on the door: 469. His heart stopped.
Heavens above. 
Looking skywards, Trent prayed with fervor. Please, don't be it! Reluctantly, his trembling hand delved into his pocket, retrieving the crumpled parchment — his first letter of commission. Unfolding it with a mix of reverence and dread, Trent's eyes scanned the inked words, each line a potential harbinger of fate.
At the top, in bold lettering, were the numbers 469.
Of course, Trent thought bitterly. To the depths with Icar. 
Fuming, he took a deep breath, shaking. WHY ME! BLAST IT ALL!
        Trent slammed his fist against the door, wood shards mingling with the howling wind, as he sank to his feet. Tears streamed down his face as he closed his eyes, remembering. Remembering the sacrifice the kingdom had given him to oppose the king. Remembering his sister Selean’s disappointed words. Remembering Karia’s anguish as he betrayed her. </Sibier> “Why me?” he sobbed. </Sibier> “Why me?” 
        Skies, if only I had managed to keep my family hidden! Then I would never have been here. Then I would have my sword in Icar’s blasted heart. Then, we would have won. 
It was beginning to seem as if the very stars were bent around making him miserable. And what was Trent to do? He was a single man, a failure and a pariah. He no longer had any friends — his betrayal had made sure of it. He had nothing left. With tears in his eyes, Trent whimpered, but he knew he had no choice. He had to keep his family safe.
Pathetically, frail and wobbly, Trent rose to his feet. His bones felt ready to shatter underneath the crushing weight of guilt, and his throat was dry with dread. Setting his jaw, he dulled his mind, begging to pass the next few moments without thought: only savage instincts. It would be the first time he would meet the new High Executioner. 
He hit his wound with his fist, grimacing. 
Focus. 
Trent pushed door 469 off its hinges.
Immediately, the room fell completely silent: quieter than a rock. Four pairs of eyes riveted on Trent, their solemn stares fearing his militant trench coat and drawn-over hood. They frowned at the king’s insignia emblazoned on his chest, piously proud that they did not wear it. It was a mark of wealth and rumored decadence.
A mark of shame.
But, there was something else in the room too. The confined space, surprisingly clean and almost bright, emanated a subtle aura of hope—a defiant light in the eyes of those who faced him. The older son exuded a radiant determination, and his blue eyes shone with light. Trent had once been like that. He had been like that a few days ago.
Already, Trent sensed the unspoken unity as the mother and father rallied with the older son -- the toddler held in his mother’s arms -- finding strength in his leadership. This was a family that stuck together, that somehow unburied happiness in a kingdom buried with despair. And here Trent was to destroy all of that joy. Again.
        He didn’t have any tears left for this family. 
        </Sibier> “I’m sorry,” Trent whispered. 
        The family didn’t move, but Trent’s keen eye caught how the father slowly reached for the knife concealed in his boot. They were going to fight, Trent realized.  Blast it.
</Sibier> “I’m sorry,” Trent repeated a little stronger, </His> “but you must come with me.”
        The only woman in the room, tucked the toddler behind her back. Her face darkened: they all knew what obeying Trent’s words would spell for them. No one returned from a walk with the High Executioner. No one returned from the Trials. 
The older son stepped forward. His fist clenched around a rock. Their piercing stares met as the boy faltered, recognizing the face hidden behind the hood. </His> “...Trent?” he questioned, his speech riddled with confusion but blanketed in hope. </His> “The rebellion scattered after hearing your death...” he whispered, almost in awe. </Sibier> “But with you back we might have a chance! You’re alive!”
Any remnants of goodness within Trent crumbled in that pivotal moment. Tears welled in his eyes, a silent testament to the storm of conflicting emotions raging within him. </Sibier> "That man is..." He hesitated, his breath catching in his chest. Disconnected, Trent lowered his gaze to the ground, a battlefield of echoes—pain and hope—ravaging his mind.
His hand rose to wipe away the evidence of his internal turmoil. </Sibier> "Come with me, please," Trent implored, his voice strained. </Sibier> "Don't make this harder for either of us."
Disbelief contorted the boy's features. </Sibier> "You..." he croaked, the word caught in a dissonant mix of betrayal and disbelief. </Sibier> "You betrayed us?"
Heart pounding in his chest, Trent’s lips trembled, eyes watering. Slowly, he gave a slight nod. </the father> “I’m sorry.”
 </Sibier> “TRAITOR!” the father boomed. Thrusting with his knife, he lunged at Trent. Face solemn, the High Executioner mindlessly sidestepped the attack, grabbing the father’s arm. With a practiced twist, he broke the man’s wrist, throwing him to the ground. The father crashed hard, barely muffling his scream.         
Trent shivered, feeling his soul cry out within him. He didn’t have the heart to do this. But he had to.
</Sibier> “Please, come with me,” Trent begged. </the father> “You won’t beat me. Maybe you will be the ones to survive the Trials.”
Coughing, the father turned to the older son. </his> “Sibier, get your brother and run.” Wheezing, the old man tried to stumble to his feet but collapsed back to his knees. </Sibier> “Save yourself. Save Ilyian. Save our dreams.” 
Giving the man time to speak, Trent sniffed, the father’s humble cry stirring him. </Sibier> “I’m sorry,” he whispered again, as if those two words were a shield against the pain. 
</Sibier> “Sorry means nothing,” Sibier spat. </her> “I can’t believe I ever admired you.” Grabbing a rustic sword from the mantle, he erratically slashed it. Trent could tell the father had skill, but this boy did not. Easily, he ducked underneath the blade, ignoring his own weapon dangling on his belt. Diving inside Sibier’s reach, he kicked out the kid’s feet.
Next, a brutal punch.
Sibier crumpled to the ground, yet in the dim light, Trent discerned an unwavering determination that flickered in the young man's eyes. The fire within Sibier refused to be extinguished.
Trent hesitated. How could I deliver Sibier to the Trials? In the nineteen-year-old, he glimpsed a reflection of his former self—a version of Trent who once held pride in his identity, who wanted the world to recognize his name. A version that believed in the elusive concept of goodness concealed somewhere in the world. And, he had found that good too, but he had let it slip through his fingers like blood. Blood of all those people who had sacrificed themselves with honor to get him with a sword at Icar’s throat. And he had let it all go. He had let it all slip through his blasted fingers.
No wonder he always wore a glove.
Closing his eyes, Trent grappled with unbearable pain. In Sibier, he saw a reflection of the person he used to be, a soul ablaze with the desire to be better, to do better. It was a plea for redemption that echoed through the corridors of his memories. He couldn't bear to look Sibier in the eyes and raise his sword. The prospect of killing his past haunted him.
With a frown on his lips, Trent stood, motionless. What could he do? He took a deep breath and closed his eyes… and kicked Sibier. The mother shrieked as she set down her child, tugging at his trenchcoat. </Sibier> “Please, Trent,” she pleaded. </Sibier> “Remember who you are!”
Trent sniffed, his backhand smashing into the mother’s fragile jaw, shattering it like crystalline glass — beautiful, but easily broken. </Sibier> “I haven’t forgotten,” he whispered, through tears. </Sibier> “Forgive me.”
Roughly grabbing her, Trent lifted the dazed mother off the ground. With a sunken heart, he threw her into the ground. He heard the bones crack and his heart splintered. What am I doing? Why am I breaking these people? 
With blood matting her hair, the mother weakly pushed her face off the ground and looked at Trent. In her face, Trent saw the features of his own mother. 
He froze, his heart refusing to beat. What have I done! 
Stumbling to his feet, the father wavered as he wildly swung the knife. Blinking away his momentary stupor, Trent kicked the mother across the floor, sending her body crashing into her husband’s feet. Together, they crumpled into a bloody heap. Trent felt as though he had kicked himself instead. 
Clutching his side, Sibier rose. His skin bruised underneath his tattered clothing, his lip already swelling. His determination, however, suffered no such blows. </Sibier> “Leave them,” he commanded, </Sibier> “and take me. I will risk the Trials.”
Trent faced the kid, seeing him with hollow eyes. </Sibier> “No. You will run,” he said, devoid of emotion. </Sibier> “Take your younger brother and run.” His words almost felt like a whimper.
Sibier’s eyes darted, but he remained still. Trent could see his rage churning in him, and saw as his muscles tensed to charge. Idiot. 
</Sibier> “GO NOW!” Trent screamed. </The Vagrant> “Or I will have to kill you too!” Closing his eyes, he finally unsheathed his blade, feeling the familiar weight in his palms. He welcomed the release from thought, relishing the feeling of pure instinct. Emotionless passion.
Sibier scampered to his feet, grabbing his younger brother quickly. Rushing out the door, he took a final look back to see his father wrap his arms around his mother in one final embrace. He closed his eyes, muttering, as he prayed to the skies. The High Executioner turned to face his parents, blade in hand. 
Then Sibier slipped out into the storm. Never again looking back.
________________


Out of the Ashes
Chapter Four






















Sibier’s hair bristled as he listened to the nearby vagrants. 
</the bigger vagrant> “Look at that slithering soldier eating in our faces just to mock us,” the vagrant complained to his partner, his resentment tainting the air. Siber sniffed, squinting against the blistering wind that whipped in from the ocean. His stomach rumbled, twisting in hunger, but unable to consume the knot of hatred that boiled in him. Skies, he had lost everything. 
Ilyian — his four-year-old brother — tugged at Sibier’s shirt, letting out a low whine. Ilyian’s dark hair was matted like Sibier’s, but his face was softer and rounder: evidence of the food Sibier had always shared with him. 
Ilyian’s bright-green eyes looked up at him longingly as he tugged. Sibier sighed, leaning back slightly to let his younger brother climb onto his lap. Not everything was lost, he thought, as he wrapped an arm protectively around Ilyian.
With sharp blue eyes, Sibier stared at the soldier, his face hardening against the blistering wind. Ocean spray pelted his skin, giving him a dangerous, glistening appearance. His thick black hair, usually kept short, was now rugged, with wet strands whipping against his cheeks. His bones were visible beneath his skin, and his veins rippled with every movement. He was lucky enough to have more food than some. 
Fingering a shard of broken glass in his back pocket, Sibier wondered how the grain the soldier held would taste. His hand tightened around the edge of the glass as Ilyian pressed his face against Sibier’s chest, whining softly. Heavens above, they needed food… and he wanted revenge.
For all nineteen years of his life, the Kingdom had mocked, abused, and terrorized Sibier. Before, he had taken it with his chin held high, smiling unfazed as his parents had taught him. But now, with his parents gone, all he wanted was to make the Kingdom pay.
Save our dreams, echoed the haunting voice of his father. Sibier clenched his fist, taking a deep breath. He would, but he would also make the Kingdom hurt for what they did to him. 
Leaning forward, Sibier listened to the two vagrants huddled behind a rock, sheltering themselves from the ocean’s buffets. The taller companion spat on the ground, his broad build making the motion awkward and almost pitiful. He likely had once been a soldier; a peculiarity in times when warriors were scarce and even odder now when they were so essential. In today’s Kingdom, almost anyone would do anything for a meal, and being part of the policing force was one way to do so. Sibier bit his lip; he hated that. They all did.
The larger vagrant turned to his smaller companion, easily dwarfing the older man. His features sagged, and cuts crisscrossed his face as though a bird had decided to draw on it with its talons. </the bigger vagrant> “We should fight him, Terit,” the bigger vagrant muttered gruffly. </Sibier> “Take our food back.”
Sibier smirked, echoing the deep-rooted bitterness inside of him. These men are desperate, he realized. It had been men like them a few weeks ago who had started the mob on Earl’s Road and embarrassed the king’s forces. It had been men like them who had voiced the unrest of the people. And it was men like them that Sibier needed.
Gently setting Ilyian by a rock beside him, Sibier bit his lip. Time and time again, his father’s last words whispered in his mind, as though the man never left him. Save yourself. Save Ilyian. Save our dreams, his father had asked. Their family had tried to do just that for years, and finally Sibier had little left to lose and that made him reckless. 
Pausing, he took a deep breath, and gazed up to the stars. </Sibier> “I will,” he promised softly. </Terit> “I will do it, Father.” The stars seemed to twinkle back at him, as if acknowledging his vow. Yet, he hoped the stars didn’t see deep enough to see his other, darker desires. 
Nearby, Terit, the scrawny vagrant, spat out a mouthful of blood-tinged sand. </Terit> “It’s pointless, Yorin,” he muttered, his voice heavy with defeat. </Ilyian> “We either starve or die at the tip of his sword.” The despair in Terit's sagging eyes reflected his malnourished form, slumped in resignation as his tongue continued to roll more sand around in his mouth.
Sibier watched them closely, a fire kindling within him. The echoes of his father’s legacy, the plea to save their dreams, resonated in his mind. This could be the start, he thought. This could be the beginning of fulfilling my promise.
He pulled Ilyian into a tight hug, feeling his brother’s fragile breath against his neck, a small warmth against the biting cold and howling wind. Whispering to him, Sibier’s words reflected the consuming worry that gnawed at him. </Ilyian> “Do you think we’ll survive this?”
        Ilyian pulled back, his wide eyes brimming with distress. The boy hadn’t eaten in nearly two days, and his eyes were red from crying. </Sibier> “Where’s Ma?”
Those words, spoken by the innocence of his brother, tore through Sibier. His lips quivered as he struggled to hold back his tears and he clenched his fists, anger and sorrow intertwining in his heart.How could this have happened? Skies, It wasn’t fair. The injustice of it all burned within him. After a lifetime of fighting to build something, to honor his family’s legacy, everything had been ripped away. The kingdom had taken it all, leaving him with nothing but a seething, bitter rage.
Sibier’s eyes narrowed as he glared at the distant figure of the captain of the seventh district. Men like him had heckled Sibier throughout his childhood for his family’s broken name. Now, they had finally taken everything. But I will not let them take our dreams, he vowed silently. Not while I still breathe. 
The salty wind stung his cuts as he confronted the bitter truth—there was no refuge, no sanctuary for them. There was nowhere to run where food would abound, where his parents would live again, and where safety would embrace him.
Biting his lips, Sibier’s fist tightened around the shard of glass in his pocket, his eyes locking onto the captain. He needed food. He needed to save his family’s dream. He needed vengeance. 
Turning to the vagrants, Sibier set his jaw. </Terit> “I’ll get you both some food.” 
Yorin narrowed his eyes and Terit scoffed. </Sibier> “What are you going to do kid?”
Sibier didn’t answer, as he leapt over the sheltering rock, letting Terit’s words become lost in the howling wind as he headed straight for the captain. Two fish lay on a tray beside him, as the man spooned soppy grain into his mouth. Half of it was pushed to the side, giving the impression he was saving it for later… skies, even this soldier was eating rations.
        But it was too late now to turn back. This is it, Sibier realized. This is where I start. He looked heavenwards, whispering a prayer in his heart. His mind raced, doubts about his plan swirling like a storm. 
        Sibier could almost feel the vagrants watching him from behind, likely placing bets on how long it took before he had a blade in his gut. Yet, he saw Ilyian out of the corner of his eyes, poking nearby moss and laughing as the plant puffed its fumes. He gave a half-hearted chuckle. With Ilyian’s innocence propelling him, he stomped up to the guard, stopping mere inches away — close enough to smell the man’s sweat. The uniform’s colors were faded from years of use, although his blade was well polished, branded with the king’s insignia of a crow;  this man wasn’t merely a soldier — he was a captain.
Sibier bit his lip. A captain was on rations? He felt a chill crawl down his spine. This is suicide. 
Burying his fear deep within him, Sibier raised his chin, staring straight into the captain’s eyes. </He> “Your name, sir?”
The captain allowed a smug smile to tug at the corner of his lips. He spooned more grain into his mouth, speaking through a mouthful of food. </Sibier> “Go your way.”
Sibier’s throat went dry, but he refused to show it. </He> “I asked for your name, not a retort,” he repeated, his voice steady. His father’s final words echoed in his mind, infusing him with courage. Even so, his legs trembled, goosebumps running down his skin. Breathe.
        </He> “It is Captain Werrin to you not sir,” the captain barked, his amusement giving way to irritation. </Sibier> “Do not disrespect me again.”
The words cut through Sibier like a dagger, but he managed a faint smile, tilting his head slightly. His hands shook in his pocket, yet he kept his voice firm. </Werrin> “Give me your food, Sir Werrin, and I will be happy to leave.”
Werrin abruptly stood up, roughly pushing Sibier away. </Sibier> “You get my scraps, urchin.”
Heart pounding in his chest, Sibier stepped forward, acting on instinct. Adrenaline pulsed through his veins, memories of his parents burning bright in his mind. Save our dreams. Each move felt guided by the stars, and he felt as though courage had been poured upon him from above. 
Sibier got close, close enough to smell Werrin’s breath. </Sibier> “That mess back on Earl’s Road,” he threatened, fists clenched tight. </Sibier> “You wouldn’t want reports trickling in that you were in charge, do you? That you were the one who let the riot unfold, the one who failed to strike down three derelicts?”
Werrin cursed, his hand going to the pommel of his sword. Sibier didn’t flinch. </Sibier> “You better leave me alone, urchin.” 
Sibier cocked his head, noticing the discomfort in Werrin’s eyes. </Sibier> “You kill me here and you’ll look even more like the culprit,” Sibier chuckled, forcing bravado into his words. </Werrin> “I have friends watching right now who’d be happy to testify they saw you on Earl’s Road. I don’t think any of them would mind being promoted to captain…”
        Werrin’s face paled. </Sibier> “You’re bluffing.”
        Sibier shrugged, though sweat began to bead on his forehead. </Sibier> “Then call my bluff,” he challenged, </Werrin> “or just give me your food, and I’ll be on my way”. 
Werrin’s fingers tightened around the handle of his sword, his eyes narrowing into small slits. Sibier’s heart froze in his chest. I went too far. Skies, I went too far! 
        Sir Werrin stared at Sibier, his face unreadable as the silence stretched between them like a taut rope ready to snap. He could hear the blood pounding in his ears, the tension sticky in the air. Time seemed to drag on for eternity, and Sibier had to fight off the urge to run. Every instinct clawed at him to flee. 
Finally, Werrin took his hand off his sword, sighing. </Werrin> “I could use more men like you,” he whispered. He sat down, spooning more grain into his mouth. </Werrin> “But your threat is a lie, kid.” 
Sibier sniffed, at a loss for words. He felt ready to throw up, and his stomach growled loudly. After another bite, Werrin smirked and pushed the tray towards Sibier. </Werrin> “Here.” He wiped his mouth and stood up. </Sibier> “Be back here tomorrow at first light, and I’ll bring your enlistment papers to sign. You won’t have to worry about starving any more.”
Sibier blinked, bewildered. He took the tray, saying nothing. 
</Werrin> “What was your name, kid?”
</Sibier> “Sibier.”
</Sibier> “And your last?”
Sibier hesitated: every kingdom officer knew his last name, and they all hated him for it. He could lie, but he knew he wouldn’t. He wouldn’t forget his family’s legacy.  </Werrin> “It's Sogni, captain,” he answered. 
Sir Werrin paused, his eyes narrowing. When he spoke again, his tone was a little more brittle. </Werrin> “I had heard that the High Executioner had finally visited the last of the Sogni.”
Sibier tensed, the fresh sting of memories flooding his mind. He could still hear his parents' screams, feel the paralyzing chill of fear in his bones. They had been his world, and now they were gone—ripped away by the merciless kingdom. By the High Executioner. By Trent, the rebellion leader. The bile of hatred rose in his throat as he swallowed hard. How could he even consider joining the kingdom’s guards? What would his parents think?
Werrin leaned forward, clearly interested now. </Sibier> “How did you escape?”
Thoughts raced through his mind, as Sibier scrambled to come up with a believable lie. If he knew I had escaped, would he turn me in? With his heart pounding in his chest, Sibier answered quickly. </Werrin> “I didn’t hear about that. It’s not my name by birth — I adopted it when David Sogni saved the rebellion.”
Werrin inspected Sibier, speaking slowly. </Werrin> “I was there,” he paused, reflective. </He> “David lost his closest friend that day. In his sorrow, he became a tempest of rage, and he had that same look in his eyes that you do.” The captain smirked. </Werrin> “David never fought again after that. It broke him.”
Sibier bit his lip, fighting back the tears in his eyes. This was not the time! But this story was close to his heart. He knew it well.
 Werrin continued to watch him, and after a few seconds, he seemed satisfied. </Sibier> “Welcome to the team, Sibier.” 
Sibier nodded, picking up the tray, hiding the cacophony of emotions inside. </My> “I’ll see you tomorrow.” He wasn’t sure if he meant those words.
With his hands full, Sibier strode back to the vagrants, their jaws agape. They looked at each other with complete astonishment, neither saying a word. 
Ripping off a small piece of one of the fish, Sibier handed the fragment to Ilyian, who was enthusiastically clapping his hands. Heavens above, he thought, everything is good to that kid! He tossed the remaining fish to the vagrants, sitting down next to them and picked up the spoon. 
        </My> “My name is Yorin,” the burly one said slowly, stupefied he was holding food. His eyes were wide, and he took a cautious bite.
</My> “Terit,” the other mumbled, unbelieving. </Sibier> “My name is Terit.”
        Sibier smiled, feeling hope rekindled in his heart. He lifted Ilyian, slinging him triumphantly over his shoulder, and finished off the meal. It hadn’t been much, but it was something. </Sibier> “My name is Sibier Sogni,”  he smiled. </Terit> “And I believe we can create something where none of us will go hungry again.¨
Yorin and Terit exchanged glances, their brows raised. “He is the one the stars would send…” Yorin whispered reverently, only for Terit to interrupt.
¨You can get us more food?” Terit asked, his tone sharp with skepticism.
Sibier shrugged, shifting Ilyian onto his hip. </Sibier> “Maybe,” he paused, feeling the weight of his words. </Sibier> “I have a dream for this kingdom. Do you want to be a part of it?” 
He heard Yorin clamber to his feet, Terit’s curses following. </Yorin> “The one blessed by the stars…” Yorin started, his voice tinged with awe. </Yorin> “Who are you?”
Terit rolled his eyes. </Terit> “Yorin spent too much time in jail reading from those dilapidated words,” — </Yorin> “scriptures,” Yorin interjected, but Terit ignored him — </Terit> “anyways, he’s a little gone up here,” he said, tapping his head. </Terit> “To the depths with it all though, because we’re in… but what's the plan, kid?”
Ilyian plopped the chunk of fish into his mouth, then promptly hugged Sibier. Together, they laughed.
________________
Reaching for Dreams
Chapter Five
























Sibier  saw himself standing in a great dining hall. Food lined the tables, and Ilyian crawled through vines of grapes, slurping one after another. Grabbing an entire ham, Sibier distributed the abundance of food to a diverse gathering of people from across the kingdom—homeless souls finding solace, creating connections. He felt as though these people had become his family, and everyone belonged. A warm peace settled in the room as people greeted each other with friendly smiles. There was no hunger, there was no crying. Sibier smiled, as his family’s dream felt almost tangible, like it was reality just barely out of reach…
And then Sibier’s eyes twitched. The door to the dining hall crumbled, a shadow-clad figure bursting through. His cloak obscured his face, but the glint of the king's insignia on the sword's hilt betrayed his identity—The High Executioner.
Restless, Sibier turned back and forth. Helplessly, he witnessed himself attempting to shield his newfound family, but an invisible barrier thwarted his every move. Tears streamed down Sibier’s face as the High Executioner's merciless blade cut through his father and then tore apart his mother. On his knees, Sibier pleaded desperately, the anguish palpable. </The High Executioner> "Please stop!"
The High Executioner lunged. Another died. The High Executioner swung. Another fell limp. </Sibier> “Please!” Sibier begged.
Then, with a malevolent fire in the Executioner's eyes, the murderer turned towards Ilyian. He raised his sword. 


Gasping, Sibier jolted awake, drenched in sweat. Immediately, he placed a protective hand over Ilyian’s fragile form, reassured by his touch. Taking uneven breaths, his eyes darted back and forth, searching for any threats. The sun had risen, but Sibier felt as though he was still surrounded by ominous shadows. Skies. The High Executioner killed my parents. 
His nightmare stuck in his mind like tar, and Sibier scrapped his fingers against the stone beneath him. Fear rose in his throat like bile, and he felt anger rise up within him. His fist clenched as he imagined himself coming face-to-face with Trent again…
Sibier took a heavy breath, feeling his eyes water. With a trembling lip, he looked to the stars as they sparkled against the dark, weaving a tapestry of blues and yellows across the heavens. Each star seemed to pulse with its own unique character – some twinkled softly, while others danced with a more fervent light. With a soft sigh, he wondered which two were his parents. They were up there somewhere, he whispered to himself, confirming his own faith, I know it. 
He settled on two white stars, close companions in the celestial dance. They swirled together in unison, and one burst into a brilliant yellow each time it neared its partner. A tear traced Sibier's cheek as he remembered his mother always used to smile as his father reached for her. In his mind's eye, his parents twirled together in the sky, free from the hunger and fear that had plagued their earthly lives. But even in life, they had always dreamed of so much more…
Sitting up, Sibier wiped his eyes — it was his dream too. And, heavens above, he would do anything to make it happen. It was their family’s legacy, and he wouldn’t dare let it be forgotten. 
Grabbing his father’s knife, Sibier ran his finger down the blade. He knew the story behind the blade: it held a saga of its own, originally belonging to his father's comrade-in-arms. Together, they had fought valiantly in the rebellion. Then one day King Icar had discovered the rebel base, and launched a surprise attack: his father told him that his friend had saved the rebellion, but it had cost his life. Even now, Sibier could still hear the lingering sorrow in his father's recounts; after his friend’s death, his father had abandoned the cause. It was only a few weeks later that Trent revived the effort, breathing hope back into the rebellion, but by then, his father's spirit had been irreparably scarred. The price had been too much. 
And their legacy had been lost. Sibier sheathed the knife, and clipped its holster onto his belt.
Running his hands through his hair, Sibier scrapped the dirt off his arm, making himself as presentable as he could. Now, it was his legacy to revive.
Yet, despite that very legacy, here he was, considering joining the very kingdom’s forces that his very father had fought against. He hadn’t forgotten Werrin’s invitation. 
The irony wasn’t lost on Sibier – he despised their ruthlessness, the memories of their cruelty still vivid. But this... this was a means to an end, a necessary evil. He needed to do this. Skies, he needed to do this. It made his skin crawl, but without rank he couldn’t demand the respect he would need to save their dream… and one thing was clear: he would do whatever it took to keep them alive.
Even if it meant joining their abusers, dictators and tyrants. 
It would only be for a short time. 
Breathing softly, Sibier softly roused Yorin. The large man's eye flickered open, sharp with a blend of suspicion and readiness. </Yorin> “Who’s there?” he growled lowly, his hand instinctively seizing a rock beside him. 
Raising an eyebrow, Sibier couldn't help but wonder about Yorin's past. What had he been through to react like that? </Sibier> “Easy, it's just me,” he reassured.
Yorin relaxed slightly but eyed Sibier warily. </Yorin> “What’s going on then? You rarely wake a man unless there’s trouble or...” His voice trailed off, leaving an unspoken question hanging in the air.
</Sibier> "I need a favor," Sibier began, sitting back on his heels. </Sibier> "Could you keep an eye on Ilyian for a bit? I have to go somewhere."
Yorin squinted, his protective instincts visibly kicking in. </Sibier> "Where to in the dead of night?"
Sibier hesitated, the weight of his upcoming decision pressing down on him. What would he think if he told him he was going to join Werrin’s cohort? Vagrants often hated the king’s guards, and Sibier couldn’t blame them. Even growing up, he remembered hiding as a child from the guards: they always had a particular distaste for him and a particular liking to beating him — once they found out who he was. To this day, he had never met a guard who didn’t know his family’s name… but to the depths with that!
Yorin grunted, his voice dropping to a gruff, almost accusatory tone. </Yorin> “You’re not mixed up with the Darkened Dawn, are you?”
The question struck Sibier like a cold gust of wind. The Darkened Dawn's reputation was well-known; they were cultists who always seemed present, almost like a shadow. A flicker of frustration crossed his face. This is the last thing I need, Sibier thought, more suspicion, more barriers. He had assumed Yorin to be more trusting than Terit, but maybe he had misjudged the man. </I> “No, Yorin, I'm not with them,” he replied firmly, yet with an undercurrent of understanding. It was essential to maintain trust, especially now. </Yorin> “I'm just trying to do what's best for us, for all of us.”
Yorin's eyes narrowed slightly, weighing Sibier's words. The distrust was palpable, a tangible cloud hanging between them. Yet, after a moment, he gave a curt nod, seemingly satisfied with the response, if not entirely convinced.
        </Sibier> “I’m just going to get more food,” Sibier continued. It wasn’t a lie, but it certainly wasn’t the full truth either. Joining the kingdom’s guards, the very forces opposing the rebellion his father had once championed, wasn't a decision he made lightly. It was necessary, even if it left a sour taste in his mouth. The connections, the position – they were vital for achieving his parents' dream. This was… well, just a means to an end, he told himself. I won't be with them for long, and Ilyian... he hoped his brother would never find out.
Finally, the answer seemed to satisfy Yorin, and he mumbled something indecipherable. He rubbed his hands together, before once again closing both of his eyes. It wasn’t long before he started snoring again. 
Sibier scoffed. Well, I’m going to take that as a </Sibier> “Yes, I’ll watch Ilyian”. 
Taking a last look at his brother, Sibier felt his heart warm. Sometime during the night, Ilyian had crawled into the bag of seaweed[g][h] Sibier had harvested and had wrapped it all around him. His mouth was wide open like a goldfish, and a piece of seaweed dangled comically out of it. Sibier couldn’t help but smile, before he leaned down and lightly kissed his brother on the cheek. </Sibier> “I’ll be back soon,” he promised. 
Feeling his stomach rumble, Sibier gingerly tiptoed over Terit, leaving them all behind. He slipped into the shadows, using the stars to light his way through the city. He moved slowly, careful not to make too much noise. 
Crossing a bridge to another island, he scanned the area meticulously before darting from his cover. A sudden rustle halted him, his heart pounding against his ribs. Was it a thief?
Peering from behind a crate, Sibier inched closer for a better view. Nothing was there… but then the shadows shifted, revealing a cloaked figure and Sibier's blood froze. This was no ordinary thief – this was the Darkened Dawn.
The figure emerged from the darkness, their form blending eerily with the night. In their grasp, a vial pulsed with a sinister purple glow, its contents swirling with an unnatural energy. Sibier's hand instinctively reached for his knife. Whispers of magic – or curses – flitted through his mind, but he had always dismissed them as mere legends.
Swallowing, he retreated further behind the wall, his breath shallow. As the figure crept away, Sibier remained frozen, counting the stars to steady his nerves. What would happen if they found me? Do they know my name?
Time melted away, as Sibier remembered the tales about the Darkened Dawn… tales about monsters. He had never believed in that, but now? He shuddered. 
In the stories, the magic only ever came one way: by dealing with living nightmares. 
Light peeked over the ocean, its beam like a slap to Sibier’s face, jolting him from his haze. Skies, I can’t be thinking about this.  He didn’t have the time, and he had to be at the recruitment depot already. Heavens above. But his mind kept trickling back to the tantalizing image of the vial… what could it possibly have held? What could it do?
Sibier pinched himself. Focus!
Checking over the crate, the Darkened Dawn was nowhere to be seen. Exhaling a slow breath of relief, Sibier ducked behind sandbags, silently racing through the city. Despite the brightening sky and its oath of safety, a chill lingered deep in his spine, the memory of the glowing vial haunting him.
Heavens above, now was not the time! The recruitment depot awaited, and he needed to be there – strong, composed, and ready to face Captain Werrin.
        Yet, a wave of doubt washed over Sibier as he neared his destination. Am I really about to do this? There was something unsettling about accepting Werrin’s invitation, a gnawing sense of betrayal against his family’s legacy of resistance. But how else am I going to accomplish our dream? He needed the position, and he needed the respect that would come from his rank.
Setting his jaw, Sibier steeled himself. He would go through with it. The unease, and the lurking thoughts of the Darkened Dawn… skies — he pushed both of them to the back of his mind. Focus, he tried convincing himself, exhaling a shaky breath. Just focus.
        As the path ahead became clearer, Sibier quickened his pace. Rounding a corner, he caught a glimpse of Captain Werrin approaching the depot, his expression contemplative, almost troubled.
        Sibier's heart sank. What's on his mind? With effort, he slowed to a more composed walk, trying to calm his racing heart. Running a hand through his hair, he cursed silently as he noticed a stray piece of seaweed[i] clinging to his pants. Hastily, he brushed it off, hoping it went unnoticed. Luckily, Werrin's attention was still fixed on the fading stars, lost in thought. 
        Sibier passed month-old food crates towered on either side of him. Exposed to the bitter wind, the boxes were rotting, leaving a foreboding stench behind. He ignored it, instead focusing on the huge — yet fading sign: </Sibier> “Recruits wanted.” He wondered why no one had come to clear the boxes, or maintain the sign. Was the kingdom really that shorthanded?
        Gathering his courage, Sibier approached the captain. </Sibier> “Good morning, Captain,” he greeted, his voice steady but cautious. He still wasn’t sure what was going on. 
        Werrin’s gaze shifted to Sibier, revealing an unexpected depth of sorrow. Sibier faltered, taken aback by the raw emotion in the captain’s eyes. What could be weighing on him so heavily?
        Werrin, reaching into his pocket, spoke with a voice that betrayed an effort to mask his feelings. </Werrin> “You came,” he said, a hint of regret lacing his words. </Werrin> “I had hoped you wouldn’t.”
        Sibier’s unease surged like a rising tide, his instincts screaming for him to flee. Yet, he stood his ground, feet firmly planted – a silent declaration of his resolve not only to Werrin but to himself.
Werrin's lips twitched into a semblance of a smile, but it was hollow, void of genuine feeling. His gaze shifted past Sibier, prompting him to glance over his shoulder. His heart sank. Two guards now stood there, swords at the ready, glinting ominously in the dim light. 
        Sibier felt his throat dry. Heavens above, he needed to run. </Sibier> “Wh-” he stammered. </Sibier> “What is going—”
        </Werrin> “Not a word,” Werrin cut him off sharply. He produced a pair of handcuffs from his pocket, his movements mechanical. </Sibier> “Put these on.”
        Sibier recoiled, eyes wide. Arrested? This can't be happening. Desperate thoughts raced through his mind as he eyed the alleyway, calculating his chances. Can I make it?
        He clenched his fist, and he set his jaw. I have to. I have to get back to Ilyian. 
        But before he could act, a heavy footstep crashed behind him. His reflexes took over, propelling him into a sprint past Werrin. Adrenaline coursed through his veins, as he catapulted himself forward. He narrowly slipped out of Werrin's grasp, but then, abruptly, powerful hands grabbed him, lifting him off the ground.
        Time slowed as he watched his feet go airborne. He hung in the air, catching a glimpse of the tear on Werrin’s cheek. Then, the moment passed. 
The ground rushed up to meet him as he fell, a curse escaping his lips. Dazed, he looked up to see Werrin standing over him, his expression a mix of stern duty and regret… and sorrow. </Werrin> “I’m sorry, kid,” Werrin said, his voice a pained monotone.
Then, darkness enveloped Sibier as Werrin's gauntlet descended with the finality of an anvil.

As a Pariah
Chapter Six
























Trent glanced over his shoulder, his heart pounding with urgency — he only had a few minutes before he had to face King Icar in their upcoming meeting. The prison chambers, cold and suffocating, echoed with a haunting chill: he could never forget the moment he was forced to become the High Executioner. Each visible puff of his breath in the frigid air was a stark reminder of how far he had fallen.
His boots echoed eerily in the corridor, and the heavy coat of the High Executioner trailing behind him like a shadow. The guard he passed stiffened under his gaze, and Trent felt a twisted satisfaction in the man's fear. It was a hollow feeling, one that clashed with memories of who he used to be, who he fought to be. Once he had a beacon of hope, but now he was an emblem of dread.
And against his own will, he smiled. 
And now, they no longer questioned who he was, or why he was here. Everyone knew the High Executioner, and everyone gave him space. And that felt good. 
As he neared Karia’s cell, the dim light from the dying torch cast an unnerving glow. He paused, taking in the sight of her – disheveled, ye[j]t resilient. The flickering lighting made her features memorizing, but almost ethereal, like a ghost. In a way, he realized, she was a ghost of who I was. 
</Sibier> “Karia,” Trent called softly. His fingers, clad in dark leather, gripped the cold bars of her cell with a mixture of regret and resolve.
She emerged from the shadows, her broken appearance a sharp contrast to the woman he remembered. Yet, dirt and bruises couldn't mask the strength in her gaze, nor the glimmer of hope that sparked at the sight of him. She rushed to the bars, her arms pulling him close as she embraced him. </Karia> “You're alive!”
Trent nodded, acutely aware of the cold iron that separated them. When she stepped back, a torrent of emotions surged within him, and he felt a tremor run deep in his heart.
Sinking to his knees, he was overwhelmed by the weight of his choices, the path he had chosen. Her face[k], though matted with the grime of the dungeons, still held the fiery spirit he had fallen for. Her bruised cheeks, a testament to her defiance, still softened when she looked at him. And those tearful eyes, reflecting the dim torchlight, seemed to pierce through the darkness enveloping his soul. Trent felt his heart cry out. And I had betrayed all of this!
        Memories flooded in — laughter in quieter times, whispered plans under starlit skies, the warmth of her hand in his… even when he had proposed. Now, here he was, a shadow of that man, draped in the garb of his enemies. The irony of it all tightened like a noose around his heart. But I have to accept it, he thought, this is who I am now. 
        Karia’s voice broke through his thoughts, her tone laced with a mix of relief and an unspoken sadness. </Karia> “Trent, what have they done to you?”
Trent's response caught in his throat, the words struggling to navigate the labyrinth of his remorse and newfound reality. This wasn't just a reunion; it was a confrontation with the shattered pieces of their past, and the uncertain, treacherous path that lay ahead. He wished it could work, skies, he prayed that it could, but he couldn’t see how. 
        A single tear rolled down Trent’s face, as he reached for her hand. </Sibier> “Karia,” he started, </Sibier> “I’ve become something terrible.”
        Karia’s gaze flickered to the dimly lit badge on his shoulder then quickly away. In her eyes, Trent saw a reflection of his betrayal, a mirror to the pain he had caused.
</Karia> “Why,” she whispered, her voice a fragile echo of their lost dreams. </Karia> “Why did you do it?”
Trent's gaze fell to the cold stone floor, a sense of shame washing over him. </Sibier> “I had to,” he murmured. </Sibier> “There was no other way to save my family.”
</Karia> “Am I not family to you?” she croaked.
Trent’s heart plummeted, and guilt pooled in his gut. How could I answer that? What am I supposed to say? Karia was family to him. She had been his ally, his confidant, part of his very soul. Yet, in his darkest hour, he had chosen blood over bond.
He sniffled, the weight of his decision pressing down on him. Wasn’t love supposed to unify? Trent thought bitterly. Now, it seemed like his love for Karia and for his family was ripping him apart, and his heart was a battlefield of conflicting loyalties.
</Sibier> “I’m sorry,” he whispered, the words a poor salve for the wound he had inflicted.
</Sibier> “I had trusted you,” Karia sobbed, her tears a testament to their fractured past. </Karia> “I always had. I’m not sure if I should anymore.” Her voice trembled, laden with doubt and a reluctance to let go. She still held Trent’s hand, but her grip weakened.
The chasm within Trent widened, threatening to swallow him whole. </Sibier> “Then, let me make it right,” he pleaded, his voice tinged with desperation.
</Sibier> “How can you!” Karia’s outburst echoed off the walls, a raw burst of emotion. Then, as quickly as it came, her anger dissolved into a quiet, painful acceptance. She turned away, hiding her tears. </Karia> “Go away,” she whispered. </Karia> “Please, leave me alone.”
</Sibier> “You don’t mean that,” Trent pleaded. </Sibier> “Do you?”
        Silence hung between them for a moment, a heavy shroud of unsaid words. Finally, she spoke, her voice faint. </Karia> “No.” She remained still.
        Trent’s fingers wrapped around the cold bars, his resolve igniting. </Sibier> “I’ll get you out of here,” he vowed. </Sibier> “I’ll fix this.”
        Karia just looked at him, her eyes as hollow and bleak as the seas. </Sibier> “I’ll get you out,” Trent repeated, nearly frantic. </Sibier> “I promise!” He was surprised by the anger underlining his tone. 
        Karia looked deep into his eyes, speaking softly. </Karia> “You're different,” she said, almost to herself. Then she turned, facing the darkness. </Karia> “I love you Trent, but please go.”
        Stiffly, Trent held onto the prison bars. The urgency to meet King Icar tugged at him, yet his soul ached to stay, to share in Karia's desolation. A bitter truth gnawed at him: he was the one who belonged in this cell, shackled by his choices. Karia, the innocent caught in his tumultuous storm, deserved freedom far more than he.
        With a heavy heart, Trent forced himself to turn away, but not before casting one last glance at Karia. She was curled up, a figure of despair, her head bowed in a silent, private agony. Strands of her hair veiled her face, but Trent knew all too well the tears that were hidden beneath. A deep, inconsolable longing surged within him to break through the bars, to hold her, to offer her the comfort of his embrace and whisper promises of a future where everything would be alright. A future where he could be the family she deserved. A future where he could keep his promise. 
But that future seemed like a distant dream, a specter of what could have been. As he stepped back, a part of him felt like he was leaving a piece of himself behind, locked away with her. It might have been better if he too was locked away in a cell.
        </Sibier> "I love you too," he murmured, the words barely escaping his lips, a fragile confession to the empty corridor. They were words of love, but also of farewell, carrying the weight of his regret and the hope of redemption.
With a final, lingering look, Trent walked away, the echo of his footsteps a somber cadence.

The Legacy of The Cursed Child
Chapter Seven
























</Icar> “Have a seat.”
The command from King Icar hung in the air, laced with a deceptive calm. Trent hesitated, his frown deepening. Every fiber of his being recoiled in the king's presence. His fingers twitched with a primal urge, images of confrontation vivid in his mind, especially after leaving Karia in her cell. His visit with her had left a pointed bitterness lingering on his tongue.
Karia, Trent mused, would never just sit and listen. She'd be the blade at his throat.
King Icar stood tall, cloaked in black garments edged with silver that whispered of elegance and danger. The attire enhanced his aura of control, underlining both his confidence and the darker, more cunning aspects of his character. Trent knew that Icar wasn’t just a tyrant; he was a predator at the height of his game – calculated, dangerous, and alarmingly intelligent. And Trent hated him.
Surrounded by the maps adorning the walls of the strategy room, Trent felt like a caged animal.He felt sickened by  the impressive myriad of figurines and a replica of the kingdom sprawled across the table — a commander’s dream. Now, however, he would have chosen the damp, oppressive cell with Karia over this cold, calculating environment.
Trent clenched his fist, tasting his own frustration. I just want to be with her. He shifted, annoyed with the cushion on his chair and glanced at the king. He wasn’t going to say anything first.
Icar looked at Trent like a hawk eyeing its prey. </Icar> “You let the boy go free,” he stated, his voice devoid of emotion.
Trent, avoiding Icar’s penetrating stare, responded with barely veiled contempt. </Icar> “So what?” 
Icar’s eyes, cold and blue, seemed to measure Trent with a chilling precision. </Icar> “You are the High Executioner. It's either those on your list who run the trials or your family. Your choice.”
Trent’s blood boiled in his veins. </Icar> “I wasn't going to let you kill the boy. It would have made no difference,” he growled.
</Icar> "Why are you so blasted stubborn!" King Icar's voice thundered across the room, breaking the tense silence. </Icar> "Can't you see anything beyond your own blinding self-righteousness?"”
Trent's hands balled into fists beneath the table, the knuckles whitening. He imagined what it might feel like to punch that crow-like nose… blasted idiot!
Icar leaned forward, his hands pressing flat against the table's surface, looking like a leopard about to pounce. He lowered his voice to a venomous whisper. </Icar> “This kingdom teeters on the brink of ruin. Our granaries are nearly empty, our people are shattered. Every day, the Darkened Dawn grows more emboldened.”
Trent narrowed his eyes, trying to guess King Icar’s game. Why was the buffoon telling me this?
</Icar> “Without my Trials,” the king hissed, </Icar> “we have no more hope.”
Those words were carefully chosen, designed to pick Trent apart nerve by nerve. And to the depths with it,  because it worked. 
</I> “You’ve done nothing but extinguish hope!” Trent rose abruptly, pounding the table, sending a reverberating echo through the room. </I> “I dedicated my life to rekindling that flame for our people!”
</I> “Really?” Icar chuckled, giving his thin, sly smile. </I> “If you had won, we would still have no food, our people still broken, and the Heti would have attacked.[l]” He paused, nearly spitting the next words.  </I> “Your rebellion would have destroyed the kingdom.”
Trent's hand instinctively drifted to the familiar weight of his sword. In the quiet of the room, it was just him and Icar... another chance, perhaps, to do what Karia had longed for.
</I> “Captain Werrin of the 7th district has captured the boy—”
</Captain Werrin of the 7th district> “I’m not your executioner!” Trent yelled, cutting him off sharply.
Icar raised his eyebrow, inspecting him. Trent felt heat rise within him, his fingers curling around the blade. He took a deep breath. 
When Icar spoke next it was as cold as steel. </I> “I wasn’t giving you a choice.” 
Trent's restraint shattered. With a visceral roar, he drew his blade, its metallic ring slicing through the tension-filled air. He lunged forward, every muscle taut with fury.
Icar, with an unnerving calmness, sidestepped Trent's initial assault. His expression was eerily composed, as if he had anticipated this very moment. 
To the depths with him! He swung, his sword cutting through the air, but Icar was ready. The king parried with his own blade, a still, knowing look in his eyes, a sinister tranquility amidst the chaos.
</I> "You’re not going to win this," Icar warned, his voice steady as if untouched by the storm of violence.
Trent’s response was a guttural scream, his body and soul hurling forward in a relentless assault. Icar retreated with fluid grace, countering with swift, precise strikes.  All at once, Trent’s anger and frustration and hate flooded out of him. 
His blade was a tempest of steel. In his mind, he saw those orphans clinging to his coat, begging for scraps. He hit harder, and Icar stumbled. He saw himself killing Sibier’s family. He hit harder, and the King fell to his knees. He saw the betrayal and hurt behind Karia’s eyes… blast it all! Trent lifted the blade high above his head, and brought it down with everything he had.  
And then Icar caught the blade.
Trent's eyes widened in horror. He struggled desperately with the hilt, disbelief coursing through him. How? Icar's eyes glowed an unnatural purple, his face contorted with concentration.
A chill crept down Trent’s spine, as he stepped back, wide eyed. Icar’s gloved hand began to emit a strange, hissing sound, and a sinister purple light enveloped it. Trent’s sword started to disintegrate right before his eyes, the metal corroding as if consumed by an unseen force. The blade crumpled, the tip falling away like dust in the wind.
With the grace of a lynx, Icar deftly pushed aside Trent’s useless sword, seizing the moment of shock. His hand, wrapped in an aura of sinister purple light, clamped around Trent's throat, lifting him off the ground.
Trent gasped, squirming for breath. His eyes widened, as he gaped down at Icar in panic. The King’s hand hummed, the purple light only getting brighter. Then, with a sickening squelch, Trent felt as though his soul was being torn out of him. 
The pain was unbearable. 
Frantically, Trent kicked and thrashed, but it was futile against Icar's unnatural strength. His lungs screamed for oxygen, and his soul felt as if it were being peeled away, layer by agonizing layer. Desperately, he wanted to cry out, to beg for mercy, but he could not find his voice.
In a silent plea, Trent’s eyes locked with Icar’s, a wordless entreaty for his life. </I> "Please," he tried to mouth, his vision blurring into darkness. The pain was too much. Heavens above, it was too much!
Icar gave his thin smile. He turned his head, his crow-like eyes observed Trent with an unsettling detachment.
</I> "Please," Trent mouthed again, his consciousness teetering on the edge. He clenched his eyes shut, his mind screaming for an end to the torment. He was praying for a miracle. Praying for release. Just make it stop! 
Abruptly, Icar released him. Trent collapsed to the floor, each breath a ragged, precious gulp of air. His throat felt scorched by the dark power that had invaded him, leaving a trail of searing agony.
Coughing and gasping, Trent's vision swam chaotically. Inside, he felt his very soul quiver, recoiling from the unspeakable violation it had endured.
Finally, Trent choked out the words, each one falling between different breaths. </I> “What,” he gasped, </Sibier> “did you just do?”
King Icar, with an air of nonchalance, settled into his chair and slowly removed his gloves. For the first time, Trent saw the king’s hands laid bare. One was normal, but the other – the one that had gripped him – was a sight of horror. It pulsed with purple veins, its skin etched with deep, canyon-like crevices, a grotesque map of power and corruption.
Trent swallowed hard, a primal fear gripping him as he beheld the true extent of Icar's cursed existence. Icar was more than just a tyrant… he was… he was… he was…
Trent shook his head. He didn’t know what Icar was. Heavens above. What had just happened?
Icar spoke, his authority unquestioned. </Sibier> “I am what my Trials seek to give others: true power.” His words hung in the air. </Ilyian> “Imagine what this kingdom would be like if everyone had my gift. We would be unstoppable.
“We could beat the Heti.”
Tr[m]ent choked, his lungs still wheezing for air. </Ilyian> “You got that… that curse from surviving the Trials?” Was that even possible?
Icar smirked, enjoying every second Trent layed broken on the floor. </I> “No, I didn’t go through the Trials; I survived something much worse.” The king’s smile faded, his voice almost echoing with a sliver of sadness. </Sibier> “The Heti attacked my people when I was a kid. I was the only one who escaped to this kingdom.”
        Trent closed his eyes, taking a slow breath, trying to steady himself. His eyes were wide with shock, still trying to comprehend what had happened. Yet, what the King spoke of now was almost as impossible. There are other nations? 
Normally, Trent was skeptical — especially with what twisted words the king would tell him — but that power… he wouldn’t have believed in that either. Breathing out, he wondered just how much more the King knew than him. The tyrant’s words echoed in his mind, </I> “Can't you see anything beyond your own blinding self-righteousness?” Am I really missing something?
</I> “What happened to those people?” Trent asked.
</We> “They were slaughtered like livestock, and their attack did this to me.”
Trent looked at King Icar’s scarred wrist, wondering if those had been cuts from blades. A faint purple glowed beneath his skin, his blood nearly luminescent. Slowly, he began making connections. </We> “If [n]you're not from here, then you're not King Visio’s son,” Trent realized, speaking out loud.
Icar smirked. </I> “Obviously,” he said, and Trent could feel the satire behind his words. </I> “The King found me nearly dead where the Island touches the ocean. They saw my powers as a gift from the stars, and knew that I would be the answer to free this kingdom from the grasp of the Heti.”
Trent had to bite back his tongue from giving a cutting retort. Right now, he needed answers, and Icar was blasted giving him some. This has to be the strangest day of my life. 
</Sibier> “So they adopted you?”
Icar looked at Trent, his gaze analyzing. Trent could almost hear him wondering how much he should tell. To the depths with this, he cursed. He assumed Icar had slipped this knowledge, but he had been too believing.  This is likely all some concocted lie to convert me to being the High Executioner. 
</Icar> “They gave their actual son to King Visio’s sister. I took his place, and everyone that knew had to keep the secret. Visio studied me, and began conducting “trials” to replicate my power.”
King Icar paused, and Trent could feel the king remembering his past. Maybe this was the truth… </Sibier> “Those trials soon became dangerous, and they could no longer test them on me.”
Trent’s breath stabilized, and he pushed himself to his feet. He kept his eyes on King Icar’s hand, weary that it would lash out at him. He didn’t even know what else the tyrant could do. 
King Icar stood as well, getting uncomfortably close. Trent felt his soul shiver, and his instinct demanded he run. But he was the rebellion leader: he would not back away. He could feel the King’s breath as he spoke the next words. 
</Icar> “It's time you accompany me to the Trials.”
________________
My Destiny Is Mine to Choose
Chapter Eight






























He could taste the blood behind his teeth.
        Fighting against his headache, Sibier leaned back in his chair in a small holding chamber. The sterile white walls and the bleak furnishings — merely a solitary table and an unoccupied chair opposite him — reflected the emptiness he felt inside. He had let Ilyian down. Worry for his brother gnawed at him, a bitter reminder of his current helplessness. He silently hoped Yorin and Terit hadn't neglected his brother's basic needs.
        Sibier squinted his eyes, groaning softly. Despite being awake for what felt like an eternity, relief remained elusive. He was shackled both at his hands and feet, immobilizing him; every muscle in his body screamed in protest. Never before had he felt so utterly powerless. He felt like a clipped pigeon, stuck in a cage and about to be fed to dogs. 
        He took a slow, painful breath. He imagined his little brother, cold and asking where he was…
        The door opened with an eerie silence, and Captain Werrin entered, his trench coat speckled with raindrops and fatigue etched on his face. Yet, he carried an aura of weary authority, as water dripped from his disheveled hair. In the back of his mind, Sibier could hear the thunder outside, but he doubted that was the cause for the captain’s rugged appearance. 
Werrin presented a metal tray laden with a simple meal: fish and mushy grain, the very essence of a soldier's sustenance.  </Sibier> “I brought you these, as I noticed you didn’t eat the ones I gave you earlier.”
        Sibier tried to hide the growl in his stomach, keeping his face even. Captain Werrin isn’t my friend, he told himself. The memory of the ambush and the fear that followed was vivid enough. And yet, the question lingered heavily in his mind: Why did they arrest me?
        With deliberate slowness, he reached for the fork, eyes locked on Werrin who observed him with crossed arms. Each bite was a labor, reigniting the pain that irked him and adding to his tension. </Sibier> “What do you want from me?” he finally asked, voice laden with a mix of distrust and defiance.
        Werrin grimaced, picking up on the undertones. </Sibier> “Sibier Sogni, the blasted king himself ordered your arrest,” he muttered, a hint of reluctance in his voice. </It> “They are requiring you for the Trials.”
        Sibier’s mouth went dry. He remembered when the High Executioner visited his home. He could see his blade crashing down on his father. He could feel the horror that shone in his mother’s eyes. He could hear his parents' screams… 
No!  He clenched his eyes closed, trying to block the haunting memories from his mind. His hands gripped his fork tighter, shaking. </Sibier> "I cannot face the Trials. I must find my brother," he whispered, his voice barely a thread of desperation.
        Skies, Sibier realized, my parents had died so I could escape. Now, he was captured, and his fate secured. His family’s dream would die. Ilyian would be left alone. </Sibier> “Please,” he begged, </Sibier> “let me go.”
        Werrin was silent for a moment, and Sibier could see deep into the captain’s eyes: there was conflict hidden within them.
        Please,</Sibier> " he implored, eyes locked on Werrin, searching for any sign of mercy. "Ilyian... he’s all I have left.</Sibier> "
        Biting his lip, Sibier leaned forward, searching Werrin for any sign of hope. Yet, something weighed the captain down: his eyes sagged, and his movements were slow. “The realm is on the brink,” he spoke softly.  </Sibier> “Starvation, riots, the Darkened Dawn... we're desperate for any advantage.” 
        Sibier nodded: he knew this already, but it didn’t matter. He couldn’t go to the trials. </Icar> “Please.”
        Werrin sighed, placing his fist on the table. </Icar> “We need more men to keep any control and peace. The King generously offered needed supplies to whichever district turned you in.”
Like that, Sibier realized, it's over. He felt his blood run cold. Silently, he wrestled with the cuffs around his legs, glancing at the door behind the captain. He might have better luck in the storm…[o]
        Werrin looked to the ceiling, thinking. Cautiously, he spoke. </Icar> “I’m not going to be the one to turn you in.”
        Sibier froze. What? 
 </Icar> “I need someone like you. Someone who is resourceful, determined, and bold, but mainly someone who will slip underneath the Darkened Dawn’s radar. I need a spy.”
        </Icar> “I can be your spy,” Sibier blurted. It wouldn’t give him the rank he needed, but he would survive. He could find another way to accomplish his dream, but heavens above, he needed to live. And this seemed like his chance. </Icar> "And I need my brother’s safety ensured."
        Werrin’s expression hardened. </Icar> "For this to work Sibier, we’ll need to fake your death, otherwise the other districts will find you. Your ties to the past, including Ilyian, must be severed."
        Sibier recoiled, his plea impassioned. </Sibier> “Please! He is my brother!” 
        Werrin, unmoved, faced Sibier squarely. </Sibier> “You’ll get caught if you see him and we’ll all be executed. Is that what you want?”
        </Sibier> “You don’t understand!” Siber snapped. His tone shocked himself, uncharacteristically like him, but at the moment he didn’t care. He was hungry, scared, stressed and worried. Skies, he could almost feel his parents watching him from the stars. They had taught him that the family was always supposed to stick together — no matter what. If he abandoned Ilyian, he would give up a part of who he was. He would give up their dream. He would give up the Sogni legacy. 
        He took a deep breath and closed his eyes, a prayer in his mind. Heavens above, help. I can’t let that happen. 
        Pulling off his gloves, Werrin folded his arms. </Sibier> “What is it that I don’t understand?” he challenged. </Sibier> “Don’t you understand that if you go to your brother you will only get all of us killed?”
        Sibier didn’t relent. </you> “I have to try.” He rustled with his shackles. 
        Werrin sighed, the finality in his voice a cold hand around Sibier's heart. </I> "Then to the Trials you go. I cannot protect you if you choose this path."
        Sibier's gaze drifted to the door, the symbol of an escape he knew was unattainable. The cold metal of the shackles bit into his wrists as he pondered the gravity of Werrin's proposition. Embracing the role of a spy meant abandoning any hope of reuniting with Ilyian, relinquishing their shared dreams, and betraying the legacy his parents died defending. But he would survive. Could he live with himself after paying such a cost?
        His throat tightened, the decision looming over him like a shadow. </I> "I'll do…" His voice trailed off, uncertainty clouding his judgment. He felt a tear roll down from his eyes. I never told Ilyian goodbye. 
        </Sibier> “I’ll do it,” he whispered. He felt as though those three words split his heart. 
        Werrin leaned closer. </Sibier> “What was that—” 
        Suddenly, the door crashed open, unleashing a blast of cold air that cut through the chamber. The High Executioner loomed in the threshold.
Sibier's heart seized, every instinct screaming for him to flee, yet the chains mocked his desperation. Run, he thought. But his feet kicked against each other uselessly. His heart began to pound in his chest. Run. 
        Werrin snapped to attention, his fatigue instantly replaced by rigid formality. </Sibier> "We weren’t expecting your arrival," he said, masking his surprise with respect.
        The High Executioner only grunted, keeping the hood drawn over his face. He brushed past Werrin, fixing Sibier with a gaze that felt as if it pierced through to his soul.
        The High Executioner appeared almost as a ghoul as he neared, and Sibier's mind reeled with haunting memories of his parents' final moments. Their screams echoed in his ears, their loss igniting a primal fear within him. Skies! He could hear his father’s scream. He could see his mother drool blood. His fingers clawed at his skin as he watched his father get kicked again and again. He had felt so helpless then… Run. 
        Grimacing, he squirmed against his restraints, a futile attempt to distance himself from the approaching figure.
        With heavy footfalls, the High Executioner advanced, and Sibier could smell his breath. It smelt like his father’s blood. 
Sibier snapped.
Panic overtook him, and in a moment of desperation, he toppled from his chair, his body convulsing in terror. </Sibier> "LEAVE ME ALONE!" His voice was a raw, fractured plea, his limbs flailing wildly in a frantic bid for freedom.
        Sibier's mind was a tumultuous sea of terror, each nightmare crashing into him with the force of a tempest. He envisioned his mother, bound and helpless, her cries of anguish merging with the sinister laughter of the Darkened Dawn. And there, orchestrating the torment, was Trent, his presence a shadowy specter haunting Sibier's every thought. Desperation clawed at his heart. There has to be a way out! Run.
Yet, he was trapped. Escape seemed as distant as the stars.
The cold, unyielding pressure of the High Executioner's boot against his back anchored him to the harsh reality of the stone floor. Air struggled to find its way to his lungs as panic set his body to tremble, his cries for freedom echoing off the uncaring walls. Heavens above, help me!
But his chains remained tight, and the High Executioner only pressed harder. 
In a frenzy, Sibier clashed his shackles against the stone, his eyes wild with fear. </Sibier> "LEAVE ME ALONE!" he screamed, the plea a raw burst of his dwindling hope.
The High Executioner regarded him with a chilling detachment, then turned to Werrin with a command cold as the grave. </his> "Ensure he's gagged and immobilized before I take him. You have ten minutes."
Werrin's response was a terse nod, his expression unreadable. </his> “Understood.”

I Wish I Was Still Him
Chapter Nine
























Trent bore the weight of Sibier in his arms. It would have been easier to drag the kid, but he couldn’t bear the idea of causing any more… torture. Skies, I was already the cause of so much pain! Sibier’s links clattered with each step, but those chains were nothing compared to the ones Trent felt tighten around his own soul, a constant reminder of the freedom he'd sacrificed in service to darker duties.
He took in a slow, chilled breath. His breath clouded in front of him in the cold as it seeped into his bones. Few dared tread here, in the depths where the echo of dripping water was the only sound breaking the silence—a silence that seemed to ominously hint of the impending Trials.
Trent closed his eyes momentarily, listening to his own heart beat faster and faster. Never had he imagined coming down here. 
And still, he felt Sibier tremble against him, and Trent recognized the fear masked behind a veneer of bravery. The kid was a mirror to his own past—only three years ago—when hope was his fortress and determination his shield. Yet, here he was, a ghost of that former self, ensnared by choices that forced him to destroy those who were like he once was. 
The cave's walls constricted as they neared an imposing iron-clad door, a barrier to the unknown that even Trent dreaded to uncover. His thoughts wandered to the darker corners of these caves, half-hoping for a merciful end by some unseen monster than to face the reality of his actions and pass through that door.
It would be better than delivering Siber to his death. 
Trent reached out his hand, his fingers closing around the cold handle, and paused. Despite knowing the grim odds, Trent clung to a sliver of hope that Sibier might defy fate. Yet, this hope was a fragile shield against the guilt that consumed him, a futile attempt to justify the unjustifiable. He knew—and they knew—that they would not survive, but Trent couldn’t bear the weight of that truth.
Heavens above, I’m not ready for this. He doubted if he ever would be.
With a solemnity that felt more like a prelude to a requiem than a mere procedure, Trent inserted the key into the lock. A soft click, almost a sigh of resignation from the door itself, heralded their entrance into the dimly lit chamber. Sibier, with eyes firmly shut, was silently reciting what seemed like a prayer or perhaps a plea for strength.
Stepping through, Trent entered. King Icar stood hunched over a complex panel of controls, his fingers turning a small dial. His trench coat hung loosely on the chair behind him, exposing his cursed arm completely. He felt Sibier tense in his arms and Trent felt it echo down to his own soul.
Trent's gaze swept the room, quickly noticing the other door leading into the testing room. Because of the glass wall above the control panel, he could easily see into it. Inside, there was a singular wooden chair, with its edges frayed and worn. Surrounding it, like the tentacles of an octopus, stretched out clear tubes that seemed to burrow into the very heart of the cavern. At the end of each of those tubes was a ball of thin pricks — almost like a thousand, tiny needles on a pin cushion. 
A pervasive hum filled the air, a sound that seemed to resonate with Trent's growing disquiet, amplifying the unease that gnawed at his insides. Heavens above, it all felt wrong.
Finally, King Icar looked up, his lips drawn into a thin line. </Sibier> “How fairs our testee?”
Trent gazed down, peering into Sibier’s eyes. There was a fire deep within them, but it intertwined with a dark fear, painting an expression of almost inexpressible horror. Trent softened his grip. 
</Karia> “He is,” Trent paused, </Karia> “pained.”
Icar grimaced, scanning Sibier. </Sibier> “I’ve seen worse.” He fiddled with the dials before him, each twist seeming to tighten the knot of apprehension in Trent's stomach. </Sibier> “Let’s prepare him. Follow me.”
Trent felt a rebellion stir within him, an aversion so strong it nearly overwhelmed his sense of duty. Yet, he followed Icar into the room that housed the chair and its sinister appendages as his resolve wavered, carrying Sibier still in his arms. Trent didn’t voice his unease. 
Icar led the way into the chamber, its cold, clinical air suffused with dread. </Karia> "Place him in the chair," he commanded, an order Trent followed with a heavy heart, gently seating Sibier amidst the forest of tubes and needles.
Icar seized a tube, and its needles glinted in the flickering torch light, </Karia> "Secure him." 
Trent nodded. His hands were steady yet gentle on Sibier's shoulders, a silent apology for the role he was forced to play. Sibier’s head turned back and forth, his gag puffing in and out with each of his frantic breaths.
Trent's gaze locked with Sibier's, and in those dilated pupils, he saw a mirror to his own soul. Like a surging wave inside of him, the urge to free Sibier rose and was overwhelming, every fiber of his being screaming in protest. He saw not just Sibier trapped against his palms, but his own younger self—full of resolve and hope. And he held him still, ensuring their death.
Dryly, Trent swallowed. Sibier was likely the age he had been when he revived the rebellion three years ago. He could feel the same determination burn within the kid he once had. The same hope. Trent’s grip loosened a little, and he felt a sour taste in his mouth. He felt as though he was killing himself. 
The feeling tore at him, but he knew he couldn’t let Sibier go. Because if he didn’t, Sasha would be sitting where Sibier was sitting. Sealean next, and then his parents. Trent felt a tear come to his cheeks. He couldn’t bear the thought of pinning Sasha to this chair… Trent pushed a little harder.
As Icar administered the needles with a cold efficiency, Trent was forcibly pulled from his reverie by Sibier's stifled screams of agony. The sound tore through Trent, shredding his resolve and his heart alike. How could I be doing this? He closed his eyes, unable to watch the pain on Sibier’s face. 
Another tube, another scream—this one so primal and desperate it echoed off the stone walls, embedding itself into Trent's very soul. Underneath his palms, Sibier's body convulsed, shaking, and pleading for mercy. I have to let him go. I have to! 
But heavens above, he was pinned just as much as Sibier was. 
The screaming didn’t stop, but only got worse. It got louder. It was haunting. This was worse than death; this is an annihilation of the remnants of my own spirit.
Sibier lurched forward, catching Trent off-guard. Instinct took over, as he slammed Sibier back against the chair, applying more force than intended. A grimace crossed Trent's face as he heard something crack. Skies. 
Trent was met with Sibier's resolute gaze, his jaw clenched in silent defiance despite the blood that now dripped from his neck and limbs—where the needles cut through his skin. Sibier's appearance was haunting, reminiscent of the mythical sea creatures from children's tales, yet marked by a very real, very human pain.
And something else caught his eye. The rope binding Sibier’s feet was fraying, and it was nearly cut. Trent must have stepped on it when he pushed Sibier back… and now it was thin enough the kid could break it. 
Trent's eyes flickered to King Icar, gauging his awareness. The king seemed preoccupied by his own thoughts, hesitating momentarily before signaling for them to leave. </Sibier> "He is prepared," Icar stated.
Trent nodded, silent. King Icar turned his back. With a swift, almost imperceptible motion, he flashed his knife, fraying the rope binding Sibier’s arms. Offering Sibier a fleeting wink, Trent turned and followed Icar out of the room. The iron door closed with a somber echo, sealing Sibier's fate. Trent, pausing to look back through the glass at Sibier, felt his heart collapse.
Tubes entangled Sibier like a fish in a net, as he shivered and jerked — the ropes restricting him. Tears welled in Sibier’s eyes, and he closed them, biting down on his gag. All of it — the stench, the fear, the emotion — struck a chord in Trent. It was a poignant reminder of the human cost of his actions, chipping away at the remnants of his heart.
Trent stood, paralyzed by the gravity of the moment, his mind a whirlwind of regret and self-reproach. The thought of Sasha enduring Sibier's fate was unbearable, igniting a fierce protective instinct within him. Yet, the irony was not lost on him; he was prepared to dismantle the kingdom to save one close to him but remained motionless as another. Another who was not so different from his younger self. A young man who, like Trent once did, held the potential to uplift the kingdom from its despair.
And there he remained, inactive, a bystander to the unfolding tragedy. The self-loathing was palpable.  </Karia> "To exist like this is worse than death," he muttered under his breath, but deep inside, he felt a darker feeling lurk inside of him. A growing feeling that he was ok with it. A gnawing feeling of complacency. Gritting his teeth, Trent mercilessly hit his side, his wound still open. He was going numb… and he hated that too.
[q]
Perhaps I’m becoming this way, he mused bitterly,  because the Trent who once stood for something greater had been extinguished, leaving behind only the High Executioner, a figure detached from humanity and empathy.  The High Executioner simply didn’t care. 
Heavens above, my name isn’t the High Executioner! Trent again hit his side, squinting again with the pain. He had to do something. He had to show that he did care. Or Trent would die along with Sibier. 
King Icar initiated the procedure with a calloused flick of a lever, and Trent felt the weight of the moment settle upon him. </Karia> "Let's begin," Icar announced, oblivious to the tumult raging within Trent.
Trent couldn't stand idly by and watch another part of himself perish with Sibier. It was time to act, to demonstrate that he hadn't forsaken the values he once held dear. They needed a miracle. And perhaps, just perhaps, it was Trent himself who needed to be that miracle.
        With a click, the torches went dark.
        The Trials had begun.

The torture would not cease.
Sibier’s gaze unfocused as he steeled himself, battling to keep his thoughts collected. Fight it! Fight it! You can beat this. Beat this for Ilyian! He shook, quivering both from the pain and his resolve. Fight it! 
The sensation of the tubes burrowing beneath his skin was unnerving, evoking images of insects ravaging his insides, each movement threatening his grip on sanity. A wave of nausea washed over him, fear and sickness intertwining. Insanity, Sibier trembled. I’m going insane. 
Yet, thoughts of Ilyian anchored him. The weight of his legacy, their shared dream, and their promise became his beacon in the torment. Was he alright? He had to survive this. He had to get back to his brother. He had to fulfill his promise. 
Their dream. Their legacy. 
Sibier tensed up, calm despite his oppressive fear. You can do this. He took a deep breath, staring up at the High Executioner in defiance. Then, a sharp pain burst from his arm, and Sibier jerked forwards, screaming. He kicked out, but the High Executioner brutally forced him back. He hit his head on the chair, and his vision swam. Something caught in his throat. I can’t breathe!
I can’t breathe. 
I’m going to die. I can’t breathe. 
Sibier choked, squirming as he felt the needles crawl underneath his skin. Luckily, whatever caught in his throat shifted, and he panted for breath. His stomach heaved in revulsion, his entire body revolting at the intrusions. He could no longer control his quivering fear. He couldn’t stop it. He was going to die.
But Ilyian!
His mind was spinning, and confusion muddled his sense of time. Had The Trials begun? He icthed to rip the needles out of his skin, but he was bound. Helpless, he could only writhe against his restraints, the room now ominously empty.
It started as a low hum. 
Sibier shuddered, imagining what the noise could be. A slow clicking of metal echoed into the room, and a slow hiss. Frantically, he blinked his eyes, trying to make sense of his surroundings. Skies, it all hurt so bad! 
A strange mist seeped through the crevices of the cobblestone, its odor pungent, and crackling with power. His eyes widened, jolting back in his chair, tearing at the rope that bound him. It held firm. 
The noise grew in intensity, its unnatural beat embedding itself in his mind. Sibier shrieked, his yell gargled by his gag, as the purple lightning began dancing in the mist. His hair stood up as the mist thickened, pooling around his feet. Skies, fight it! He was going to die. 
He was going to die. 
I am going to die. 
He closed his eyes, begging for relief. He choked out two words, praying that the stars above heard him just this once. </Karia> “Help. Me.”
Then, the Trials began.
________________
The Trials
Chapter Ten
























Purple fluid flowed up the tubes. 
        And into his skin.
        Desperately, Sibier writhed out of the chair, a futile attempt to escape the encroaching nightmare. But the tubes, like parasitic tendrils, held firm. Bound and powerless, he was left to scream into the void.
        Perspiration coated his forehead as a visceral dread overtook him, his gaze fixated on the liquid's as it bubbled beneath his skin. It caused a burning itch to spread through his veins, an infernal sensation akin to swallowing flames. Heavens above, help me! Yet, the fluid didn’t stop, but only continued to tear him apart from the inside.
        Encircling his chair, the mist turned darker, climbing against his skin as if it was alive. Its touch was like a barrage of tiny, electrifying jabs. It hurt. Skies, it hurt. Sibier swallowed, as the mist eroded the ropes, melting away its fiber like acid — his skin was the same.
And where the fluid pulsed underneath his skin and where the mist gave its biting kiss, his skin blackened. It broke apart and fell like embers, giving him the appearance of scales
        My skin is going black. My skin is going black! I’m going to die! 
        But, heavens above, he needed to live.
        His entire body tensed up, protesting the foreign liquid. His muscles bulged and his veins popped, echoing his alarmed cries. With pure fright, Sibier clawed at the rope, fingers bleeding as they slowly tore threads. He jerked forwards, and his arms ripped free of the rope. Thank the skies! 
But even with the small victory in the dire circumstances, his body shriveled. Darkness threatened to take control, but Sibier gritted his teeth, focusing on the thought of Ilyian and allowing it to fuel his resolve. One by one, he tore the needles out of his neck, reclaiming his autonomy. He could feel the blood run down his skin, as he ripped out another tube, and it sputtered out the liquid. Sibier grimaced as it touched his blood, and the mixture hissed, popped, and crackled. Momentarily, he closed his eyes, as the room seemed to spin around him. 
        C’mon! Fight it! For Ilyian!
        Grinding his teeth together, Sibier cut through the rope binding his legs, leaping on top of the chair. Bellowing, he clawed out the remaining needles in his skin, throwing the tubes to the ground. A wave of nausea crashed into him, and he wavered, his vision doubling. His mind felt like it had been set on fire.
        Fighting against the mind numbing fear, Sibier anchored himself, battling to remain in control. Shadows flickered at the edge of his vision, morphing into haunting figures: the outlines of his parent’s hunkering forms… and the High Executioner with his blade raised high. 
        Sibier blinked his reddening eyes, trying to shut out those images. Resolve hardened in his chest, as he balled his fists. </Sibier> “For Ilyian!” he growled. </Sibier> “FOR ILYIAN!”
        Suddenly, A lance of pain surged through his left arm, piercing all the way to his heart. Sibier crumpled, tumbling off his chair, his hand clutching at the searing agony in his chest. Through the haze of pain, he saw flickers of lightning, its touch barely registering against the inferno in his arm. The pain inched its way to his heart, gnawing away at his sanity. He screamed, but it felt as though his vocal chords were stripped out of him. 
        Desperately, he scratched at his skin, trying to dig out the purple liquid he felt coursing inside. As blackened flakes of burnt skin fell to the ground like dandruff, a sinister purple luminescence began to peek through.
        Heavens above! My arm is glowing![r]
        Time seemed to distort as he writhed on the ground, eventually catching sight of his own palm. It pulsed with an unnatural purple, veins bulging as if alive. To his horror, scales began to form, a grotesque armor creeping up his arm, culminating in a shocking burst of energy from his fingertips. 
        Jolting back in horror, Sibier scrambled away, eyes wide. A primal fear filled him, as he frantically searched for his body for any more scales. He found no more.
        What did they do to me?
        Grappling with searing pain, Sibier gasped for breath, his eyes strained to see a cloaked figure emerging from the darkness. A crushing sensation enveloped his chest, as if mountains pressed down upon him, and his eyelids fought against the weight of weariness. Confusion swirled within him—had he completed The Trials? Had he survived? Were they coming to get him?
        Then the figure withdrew a sword. 
        The figure spoke in such a low voice, Sibier thought he had imagined it. </Sibier> “You may call me Death.”
        Struggling against the biting mist, Sibier summoned every ounce of willpower. Focus, he told himself. Remember Ilyian. Rising to his feet unsteadily, he locked eyes with the intruder. I can do this. Yet, his hands trembled, shaking off his blood.
</Sibier> “Sounds familiar,” Sibier rasped. </Sibier> “Have we met before?”
In response, Death only tilted his head dismissively. The mist seemed to roll off of his skin as though he was the source of it. </Sibier> “If it's alright with you, I’ll be on my way,” Sibier croaked. </the syndicate member> “May we meet again.”
Death only swung his sword.
Instinct took over. Sibier dove to the ground, evading the blade by mere inches. Scrambling, his fingers found a lead pipe, its touch igniting a burst of pain and light from his hands—a startling revelation of power that tore the pipe from its moorings. Skies, that was useful. 
Death pushed forwards, whirling and Sibier maneuvered, the air humming with the close calls of Death's blade. Wildly he swung his pipe, yelling. 
Death stepped back, easily dodging the attack. Sibier striked again, and again and again, moving with wild ferocity. Death kept evading, but with the long reach, the tip of his pipe finally connected, knocking him to the ground. And then, as Death's hood fell, a visage hauntingly familiar was revealed—his father?
The recognition was a shockwave, halting Sibier’s heart. But he was too late to stop his swing. The pipe cut through the figure like smoke, as it vanished into nothingness, leaving Sibier alone with the echoes of his actions and the swirling mists of uncertainty.
Sibier blinked. His heart raced as he frantically scanned the room, his mind a whirlwind of fear and confusion.  What is happening! He swallowed, feeling as though he had a ball of dread stuck in his throat. Had I killed my father?
Echoes of his parents' laughter and screams haunted him, and he could see their shadows flickering ominously in the edge of his vision. In the corner of his vision, there was his mother hunched over his Father, who lay still, broken and unmoving. 
</Sibier> “Dad!” Sibier called out, scrambling over to them. He felt tears come to his eyes as he watched his mother place a tender hand on his father’s cheek. Frantic, he didn’t dare look away. Yet, as he neared, the figures dissolved into the swirling mist, leaving behind only the chilling visage of the High Executioner, his laughter a grotesque parody of familiarity. 
Sibier stopped dead in his tracks. Heavens above, what was going on! 
The High Executioner leapt forward, drawing his blade in a quick, fluid motion. Sibier stumbled back, barely dodging the lunge. With quick efficiency, the High Executioner pushed forward, dominating the space. His blade came down in a blur.
Instinct flared in Sibier’s blood, as he raised the pipe to block. Their weapons collided, but instead of a metallic bang, there was a demonic hiss. The High Executioner’s form seems to waver like the surrounding mist, flickering with the sharp bursts of electricity. 
The High Executioner didn’t slow down. He slashed, and Sibier slid back. He didn’t see the punch. It knocked Sibier to the stone, and sent his mind reeling. C’mon! Fight it! For Ilyian! he mentally rallied, but his body betrayed him with weakness and his vision dimmed under the strain. His head might as well have been stuffed with cotton. Every ache seemed to echo down to his soul, every pain reverberating to each inch of his body. He felt broken.   
Choking on blood, Sibier faced the imminent strike, the High Executioner’s sword arcing down in a deadly descent. Get up! echoed his father's voice in his memory. Always, always get up. 
Sibier took a deep breath. He was too tired, too exhausted, too defeated. His chest rose up and down weakly, barely able to keep moving. His sight faltered, blackness clouding the edge of his vision. Get up! His father’s voice repeated. Get up for Ilyian. Sibier clenched his fists.
Biting his lip in a last ditch effort, Sibier raised his arms to intercept the blow. His eyes closed, the darkness flooded his vision. 
Please, Sibier begged the stars, Help me. 
His arm flared with a burst of purple light. His hand caught the blade. 
Grunting against the pressure, Sibier pulled with everything he had, yanking the sword out of the High Executioner’s hands. He threw it into the corner, spitting blood. 
The High Executioner remained unfazed. Instead, he drew his arm back, and punched. 
Rolling, Sibier coughed, feeling his head swim, but he wasn’t fast enough. The fist collided with his jaw, shattering his focus. The world around him went dark momentarily, and he raised his cursed arm up again. 
Effortlessly, the High Executioner kicked it aside, his boot pinning down Sibier’s scaled arm. His lips were drawn in a thin line, as he withdrew a knife. It glinted purple, reflecting the purple mist dripping down from his figure… making him appear almost ethereal. 
Sibier choked, pushing with everything he had, but he collapsed. His fingers fall limp. Weakly, he muttered what might be his last words. </Sibier> “Father and mother, I’m sorry.”


⧫[s]
⧫        ⧫


Trent’s face was stone cold, becoming an emotionless mask hiding the storm of emotions inside of him. Ominously, the mist curled around Sibier’s chair, as the kid squirmed. Trent bit his lip, pleading to the stars that somehow, someway, Sibier would escape. 
The very thought of Sibier's blood on his hands was unbearable.
In a rare moment of quietude, King Icar, with a somber demeanor, manipulated the control panel. He then sighed, his voice a murmur of unexpected vulnerability. </Sibier> “After all the times I’ve done this,” he confessed, </Sibier> “I still hate it[t].”
Icar’s confession caught Trent off-guard: it wasn’t like the king to admit something like that. His fingers tensed, and he narrowed his eyes: this must be one of his ploys for him to control me. That emotion had to be a facade. 
Sibier's desperate struggle from the chair, filled with pain and determination, momentarily drew Trent's focus. Icar’s words continued, noting the boy's resilience and echoing a haunting comparison. </Sibier> “The kid will likely live far into the trial. He has a fiery determination, and an almost unquenchable hope,” he looked to Trent. </Sibier> “He reminds me of you.”
Trent swallowed his retort, and stared straight ahead, as tears threatened to come out. The King saw what he felt: Sibier was like him, back when he was good. Now Sibier was the one to die, and he was to live. Now, as Sibier endured agony, Trent felt the weight of his own choices more heavily than ever. 
Silently and wracked with pain, Trent watched as the kid jerked back and forth with pain. The rope around his arms snapped. 
Icar nodded. </Sibier> “Yes, he will go far, but I doubt he will live.”
        Trent couldn't look away. In front of him Sibier fought to stay alive, and here he stood doing nothing. Three weeks ago, he would have done something about it. Now? Now all he did was wait. Wait for the kid to die. This time, Trent couldn’t stop the tears, and couldn’t hide his pain from the king. What have I become?
        Icar turned, analyzing Trent, but didn’t say anything about the tears. </Sibier> “With this Trial, you'll fully assume the mantle of High Executioner.” Trent knew what Icar implied: a future where Trent would oversee such horrors alone, tasked with harnessing their grim results for the kingdom's benefit. Icar was finally transitioning the responsibility of the Trials to him.
        Icar continued. </Karia> “Let’s pray you’ll finally figure the secret out of trials, and bless our people with power.”
        Trent didn’t dare speak, his emotions a tempest threatening to overflow. Shame and guilt, anger and rage, fear and desperation,  nausea and unease — all of it churned within him as he slowly turned the dial, lowering the electrical current. Icar didn’t see.
        As Trent watched Sibier, he felt as though heart was being pulled in every direction. He leaned forward, as Sibier ripped the remaining tubes out of his neck. Please, Trent mouthed, begging the stars. Please! 
        Sibier's brief triumph, however, was swiftly quelled by the mist's sentient assault, its tendrils ensnaring him with a cruel precision that mimicked purple lightning. Sibier's agony was palpable, and Trent's hope turned to fury.
        With a force born of desperation, Trent slammed his fist against the control panel, sending sparks flying. </Sibier> "Stop the trial," he commanded, his voice a raw edge of defiance. 
        King Icar's response was cold and unmoved. </Karia> "Halting now jeopardizes everything we've worked for."
        Trent felt himself beginning to unravel, his anger boiling inside of him. </Sibier> “Stop the trial, '' he demanded. 
Icar’s voice was even, always in control. “You know better than almost anyone the cost of survival. His sacrifice is necessary.”
In frustration, Trent hit his side, squinting in pain. Blast that man! He cursed mentally. He doesn’t deserve a seat among the stars. 
        And what about you? a little piece of him asked. His blood went cold, and a deepening crevice widened inside of him. Sibier winced, and the kid’s pain reverberated down into the echoes of his soul. Am I any better?
        As if in response to his hurt, the mist coalesced into a dark form, mocking Trent’s silent pleas for Sibier’s deliverance. Icar’s detached explanation only made it worse. </Karia> "The mist materializes the subject's darkest fears. It's a process, refining its horror with each iteration."
        Trent felt sick. He itched to do something, yet he felt immobilized. </Karia> “Why,” he started, </Karia> “Why do we have to do this in such a cruel way!”
        Icar kept silent, staring emptily ahead. 
        The king’s quiet pressed against Trent’s nerves, his anger threatening to explode. </Sibier> “By what star’s light,” he cursed. </Sibier> “Answer me tyrant!”
        Icar was not fazed by Trent’s outburst, but spoke softly, as if burdened by memories. </Sibier> “We do it this way because that is how it happened to me…” he paused, then shuddered. He jabbed two of his fingers forward, his other hand grasping his cursed arm. </Sibier> “I had plunged my father’s knife into Heti's back. It’s blood got into my mouth, and seeped into the cuts on my arm…” his voice was remorseful, and even filled with pain, as though he was reliving the moment. </Karia> “It changed me.”
        Trent felt no pity for the King. How could he as he watched Sibier endure the very pains worse than the very depths of themselves? Sibier backed away from the mist as it swirled and stung him, its form becoming a warrior. Skies, he needed something! </Sibier> “Can’t we get rid of the blasted mist? What’s the point anyways!”
        </Karia> “We can’t,” King Icar answered shortly. </Karia> “They never live long without it.”
        Exasperated, Trent threw his hands in the air, roaring. </Sibier> “Heavens above! Are you—”
        King Icar leaned in, his hand cutting through the air to demand silence, his eyes alight with a sudden mixture of curiosity and awe. </Karia> “Did you see that?” he whispered, a tone that beckoned Trent's full attention.
        Trent, still simmering with anger and disbelief, couldn't help but be drawn to the spectacle. Sibier, illuminated by a mysterious purple glow reminiscent of Icar's own aura, wielded a pipe with unexpected prowess. The boy was a whirlwind of desperation and determination, battling the mist that seemed almost sentient in its attack. 
Trent's heart caught in his throat. The resemblance to Icar’s mystical abilities was uncanny. Could it be? Did the Trials work?
        Had they finally created magic?
        Trent almost refused to believe it. Even though doubt clawed at Trent, he found himself unable to tear his eyes away from Sibier’s valiant struggle. Each movement, each swing, each strike was a testament to a burgeoning power Trent had never witnessed. With a move of pure desperation, Sibier plunged the pipe through the figure, dissolving it into a cloud of mist.
        Trent stepped closer, a prayer on his lips. You got this, Sibier. Just… survive. But doubt shadowed his hope. How did anyone even survive the Trials? How could Sibier possibly find his way out of this nightmare? The very concept of survival within the Trials seemed a cruel joke, an impossible feat designed to torment both subject and observer.
        As the mist coalesced once more, it formed figures all too familiar and Trent felt a cold dread grip him. He instantly recognized Sibiers parents. The apparitions were locked in their final moments just as they had been in reality, Sibier’s mother hunched over her father. The sight of her tears dripping from her cheeks onto her husband was like a crushing hand over his soul.[u]
        In anguish, Trent hit his side again, squinting through the jolts of pain. It was easier than dealing with the emotional echo of horror before him.
        Icar, ever the observer, murmured to himself, lost in thought. </Karia> "Remarkable," he said quietly, almost to himself. </Karia> "Never has the mist manifested with such clarity, such tangibility..." His gaze, fixed on Sibier’s tormented figure, was tinged with a mix of fascination and something akin to respect. </Sibier> "This boy harbors fears more potent than any I have witnessed."
        Heavens above, Trent cursed. Is this what Sibier feared the most? Reliving the destruction that I had brought to his family? Trent felt the grip of a cold specter tighten around his heart, and his guilt pooled inside of him like miasma. 
        ibier's desperate cry pierced the heavy air as he surged toward the apparitions of his family. But the scene morphed into a grotesque parody of his hopes; his father faded into nothingness while his mother's form twisted into the visage of the High Executioner. Sibier recoiled, his shock a mirror to Trent's own heart-stopping realization. Could it be? Am I what he fears most? 
        Trent felt as though he swallowed a sword. 
The mist was painfully accurate.  He felt an eerie dissonance as if he were both spectator and participant, watching himself advance with a drawn blade against Sibier. The High Executioner's relentless assault, a grim reflection of his own potential for destruction sickened him. Skies. He sickened him. 
        It was getting hard to breathe, as Trent felt like the very air around him constricted in dismay. I need to do something. 
        A fierce resolve ignited within him. It was clear Sibier stood no chance against the High Executioner. Without intervention, Sibier would meet his end here. Trent's hand instinctively reached for his sword, the metal cold and grounding against his palm.
The High Executioner advanced, striking Sibier with a brutal force that sent him sprawling to the ground. Trent nearly choked, a lump forming in his throat. It was time to act. For Sibier, for redemption, for all that still could be righted in this world gone awry. Heavens above. If Sibier were to die here, it might as well have been his own family. 
Growling, Trent drew his blade in a flash, slamming its pommel against the glass in a fluid motion. A web of fractures bloomed across the surface, and the panels shook against the pure force of his blow. But blast it! That wasn’t enough. 
His heart hammered against his ribs, each beat a ticking clock echoing Sibier's dwindling chances. He attacked the glass again, his efforts more frantic. Time was slipping through his fingers like grains of sand, each moment pushing Sibier closer to the brink of death. The glass protested under the assault, cracking further under the relentless pommel, yet obstinately refusing to yield.
Through the burgeoning network of fractures, Trent caught sight of his spectral double poised to deliver a fatal strike. It was a motion Trent knew all too well, a dance of death he had orchestrated more times than he cared to remember. This realization only fueled his desperation, his blows against the glass growing in intensity. The barrier, however, mocked him with its resilience, deepening his despair. Tears of frustration and fear welled in his eyes, spilling over as he unleashed a litany of curses. He was so close, yet impossibly far.
Driven by a primal roar, Trent gathered every ounce of his strength, his entire being focused on the next strike. The pommel hit the glass with a thunderous impact... only to be repelled. In that heart-stopping moment, as the High Executioner's sword descended upon Sibier, time itself seemed to pause. Sibier, with a prayer on his lips, weakly raised his arms. 
And caught the blade.[v][w]
Trent felt his eyes widen, his mouth opening in awe. Did the stars do that? He wondered. He stood transfixed as Sibier, with a defiance that seemed to draw from the very depths of his soul, wrested the blade from the High Executioner's grasp and cast it aside. This display of resilience, of an indomitable spirit, was a beacon of hope in the darkness. For a moment, Trent once again dared to believe in miracles.
Yet, Sibier was far from winning. Without the loss of momentum, the High Executioner’s punch cracked against Sibier’s jaw.  Adrenaline kicked into Trent’s veins. Time was running out. 
Stepping away from the glass, Trent drew a deep, steadying breath, and then abandoned all caution. In a fit of fury,  he launched himself at the glass with the full force of his shoulder. The barrier buckled under his assault, a web of fractures spreading from the point of impact, the promise of breach tantalizingly close. Shard of glass cut into his skin, and he welcomed the pain. Flames of fury roared within, each pulse urging him forward. Just one more effort. One more time. 
Meanwhile, the mist's assault on Sibier reached a merciless crescendo, its cruel kick shattering the last of the young fighter's resistance. With triumph, his boots clamped Sibier’s arm to the ground. 
And like hundreds of battles before, Trent finally felt everything come in focus. It was clear. His identity, his very essence, was inescapable.
I am this kingdom’s blasted rebellion leader!
With a resolve forged in the fires of countless battles, Trent recoiled like a spring and hurled himself with abandon. The glass  shattered, shards glittering like stars in his peripheral vision as he rolled into the fray. Sword in hand, he rose like a phoenix from ashes, his blade an extension of his will.
And his blade cut off the High Executioner’s hand. 
        The ethereal knife and hand dissipated into the air, but the mist lashed out in retaliation. The mist around his feet pricked him, feeling like little claws digging into his skin. Trent, the rebellion hero, barely even noticed. To him, pain was all too familiar. 
        Trent's heart pounded as he deftly stepped back, evading the High Executioner's swift counterattack. Droplets of sweat formed a familiar veil on his face, and he welcomed the pressure and split-second decisions. A wistful realization struck him: It has been too long since I’ve truly fought.[x] 
        The High Executioner, with a motion that seemed to defy reality, materialized a new sword from the very air. The blade was unmistakable—it was Karia's, a sight that sent a cold wave of dread washing over Trent. The presence of her weapon here, in this nightmarish duel, twisted a knot of worry within him. How was Karia? What had become of her?
        The High Executioner wasted no time, pressing the attack and snapping Trent back to the grim present. Trent met the assault with a dancer's grace, each parry and thrust a chorus of his years of training and battles fought. Every slash was precise. Every movement exact. Every swing calculated. This was his game. This was his battle. This was him. The rebellion leader. The hero who had once vanquished the High Executioner. He could do it again. 
Yet, this encounter bore an uncanny difference; the High Executioner anticipated Trent's every strategy, mirroring his tactics as though he was battling his own shadow. And when Trent dared to meet his adversary's gaze, he was met with a reflection of himself, but twisted by a deep-seated hatred and loathing that he recognized all too well. It was a part of him he had always sought to bury deep within — something that lurked in the very chambers of his heart. 
An unearthly chill crawled through him: He wasn’t fighting the High Executioner but he was confronting the darkest facets of his own soul, a manifestation of the man he feared he had become. Could this be who I am?
A spear of guilt impaled him as Karia's sword, now wielded by this dark reflection, arced towards him.  Warrior’s only wielder’s other blades when their owner had fallen…
As he raised his sword instinctively to block the incoming strike, tears blurred his vision. The memory of Karia's embrace, the warmth and safety of their last moment together, pierced through the chaos of the fight. Her defeat and her absence was a weight he bore, a silent accusation of his failure. Heavens above, he could still feel her tender arms wrapping around him, imagining the warmth of their last embrace…
As the High Executioner lunged with lethal precision, Trent's instincts surged to the forefront, pushing him to a frenzied dance of life and death. His attempt at a counter was swiftly rebuffed, the clash sending sparks of frustration igniting within him. Rage began to smolder in the depths of Trent's soul, each memory of sacrifice for her, for the rebellion, fanning the flames into an inferno.
The High Executioner was his enemy. And Trent was going to make him pay. 
Growling, he upended the High Executioner, his movements becoming a tempest of precision and fury. His assault was relentless, a barrage of strikes delivered with a cold, exacting vengeance. Vengeance for Karia. 
The trials, the very essence of his torment, became the target of his wrath. A cascade of hatred flowed through Trent; towards the trials, towards King Icar, towards the entity that dared to mirror his darkest aspects. The loathing was palpable, a bitter taste in his mouth as he swept the High Executioner’s weapon to the floor, rendering him defenseless.
There was no pause, no hesitation in Trent's resolve as he prepared the final strike. The eyes that met him were a reflection of his own, swirling with hatred and defiance. Yet, with a swift motion, his blade sang through the mist, severing the connection between them as the apparition dissolved into nothingness.
For once, Trent wished he could have had the satisfaction of sinking his blade into the man’s heart. 
Panting, the sword heavy in his grip, Trent caught sight of King Icar battling his own phantoms. Serves him right, he thought, a dark satisfaction in the king's struggle.
 But the soft groan of Sibier drew Trent’s attention back to him, breaking him from his daze. The kid was broken, his eyes glazed with exhaustion and pain. Blood caked his skin, and scratch marks covered him like he had been ripped apart by starved wolves. He was nearly dead. 
Even with the apparition defeated, a haunting vision of Karia lingered in his mind, a painful reminder of all he had lost, all he had failed to protect. With a heavy heart, he sheathed his sword and carefully lifted Sibier, the weight of responsibility anchoring him to his purpose.
Not looking back, Trent took off running.

The Warleader
Chapter Eleven
























As Trent darted through the dimly lit caverns, the weight of Sibier's unconscious form heavy on his shoulder, each step resonated like a drumbeat of urgency against the cold stone floor. He couldn’t run fast enough. Memories of his spectral doppelganger wielding Karia's sword haunted him, leaving a bitter aftertaste of dread and premonition that he couldn't shake off.
Trent swallowed. What have they done to her? 
He hoped that in trying to save his own family that she didn’t suffer the consequences. His heart beat faster in his chest, each thump more frantic—more desperate —  as a terrible realization overcame him: Sibier already suffered the consequences. He felt a lot like family. 
Sibier's condition worsened with each passing moment, his coughs growing harsher, his body trembling with feverish chills. The warm, sticky sensation of Sibier's blood seeping through Trent's cloak was a stark reminder of the stakes. He bit his lips, willing his legs to move faster. I have to go faster! 
        He shot through the mouth of the cave, sprinting through the prison corridors. He seized a torch from its sconce, its sparks dancing angrily in protest, casting erratic shadows that barely pierced the encompassing darkness. His familiarity with the prison's labyrinthine passages—a knowledge born of grim necessity—guided his frenzied pace.
        As they approached the cells, the louder Sibier's moans became, mingling with the low, despairing chorus of the imprisoned. Their anguish eroded at Trent’s soul, clawed at his sanity, and implored him to pause to extend his aid. Yet his focus remained singular: he had to reach Karia before it was too late.
        Skies, he needed to get her out before the King had her killed in retaliation for his rebellion. 
        Trent wrestled with a gnawing sense of guilt, the realization that each stand he took for freedom seemingly cast those he cared about into greater peril. Is the price of rebellion always paid in innocent lives? he wondered, his heart heavy with a sorrow that threatened to drown him. 
        Shaking his head, Trent wrestled with the feeling, grimacing. He kept his gaze straight ahead, ignoring the wails of the… the… patients — as King Icar called them, a cold euphemism that couldn't mask the reality of their suffering.  Despite his resolve, Trent found himself mimicking Sibier's uncontrollable shivers, a physical manifestation of the horror that clung to his conscience.
        What he saw he could not unsee. He had brought these people here. He had ruined their lives. 
        To the depths with it, Trent cursed under his breath, pushing the guilt aside, I don’t have time for these thoughts. His feet skidded around the corner, his momentum swinging Sibier around. The kid’s blood continued to soak into his robes, making his skin itch, and rattling his soul. There isn’t much time. 
        As Karia’s cell loomed ahead, a pit formed in Trent’s stomach. The darkness seemed to swallow the space around it, but even in the void, he recognized the silhouette of her disheveled hair and the distinctive sound of her cough. Trent’s emotion rose up in his throat at the sight of her confinement, his heart aching with a mix of despair and fury. How dare they keep her like this! 
        The presence of four guards outside her cell only fueled his anger. They unsheathed their swords as he approached, an obstacle he had neither the patience nor the time for. </Sibier> "Give me the key to her cell," he demanded, his voice echoing with a blend of command and desperation.
        One guard, emboldened, stepped forward, a defiant sneer on his face. Trent's blood ran cold with recognition—it was the guard responsible for Selean’s suffering. </Sibier> "No," came the simple, yet infuriating reply.
        A primal growl escaped Trent as he gently set Sibier down. This was no time for negotiation or mercy. With a swift movement, his sword was drawn, the metal gleaming with an unspoken threat. </Sibier> "I am your superior," he thundered, authority and rage intermingling in his demand. </Sibier> "Obey."
        The guards hesitated, uncertainty flickering in their eyes, but the defiant one held his smirk. </Sibier> "To me, you're nothing more than the traitor who's already lost," he taunted. </Sibier> "Come and claim your blasted key scum."
        Trent, fueled by a tempest of raw emotion, launched himself into the fray not needing a second invitation. His sword became an extension of his raging heart, a streak of silver that carved through the air, delivering punishment with each fluid, merciless swing. The clash of steel rang out, a cacophonous symphony accompanying his wrathful dance. He rained down a relentless assault, his blows descending like a torrential storm unleashed upon the guards who stood before him, their coordination faltering under his onslaught.
        One against four. It was almost too easy. 
As he deftly avoided a clumsy strike, Trent’s blade tore through one of the guard’s legs. The guard collapsed, his scream filling the air. Serves him right, Trent thought coldly, a grim satisfaction smoldering within him.
        Retreating momentarily from the heart of battle, Trent’s gaze unexpectedly met Karia’s. Her eyes, wide with a mix of horror and disbelief, locked onto his. The disapproval etched on her face was a silent rebuke that stung Trent more than any blade ever could.
        Then he looked away, and let that guilt be buried underneath his burning rage. 
The three remaining guards attempting to regroup, held their weapons at the ready. He smirked, the anticipation building as he toyed with the knife concealed within his cloak, waiting for the right moment…
Like a lion, Trent pounced. He flung his knife at the guard to his right, while simultaneously engaging another guard. Metal clashed against metal in a desperate bid for supremacy, his blade singing a deadly tune as it severed the guard's defense, and subsequently, his resolve. Another down. 
        The adrenaline surging through Trent’s veins was intoxicating, propelling him forward with a vigor that seemed almost supernatural. He pressed on, an unstoppable force of vengeance and wrath. The knife, now deeply embedded in another guard’s arm, did little to deter his futile resistance—a resistance that crumbled under Trent's overwhelming power. With ease, Trent’s pure force knocked his weapon out of his hand and in the next moment, his sword plunged through his stomach. 
        One left.
        The final guard wiped sweat from his eyes as his resolve melted into fear, desperately seeking an escape. Trent advanced, his presence alone enough to corner the terrified man, a low chuckle rumbling from deep within as he approached like a predator to his prey. 
        The final guard’s defiance crumbled, his sword clattering to the stone as he threw up his hands in a plea for mercy. </Karia> “Please,” he implored, his voice quivering with fear, </Sibier> “let me live.”
        The passion of anger still burned deep in Trent’s heart, as echoes of past betrayals and losses kept the burning wildfire raging within. They had killed my brother. They had killed my friends. They would have killed Karia. </Sibier> “You should have known that they call me the High Executioner,” Trent snarled, his voice low, laced with the bitterness of memories. Without hesitation, he delivered the final blow, extinguishing the life before him in one swift, decisive strike.
        He heard shuffling behind him, and Trent whirled around frantically, and his eyes wide with rage. Yet, it was only Karia, and she scooted herself far away from the bars. Her hair was disheveled, and dirt caked her face… but her eyes were sunken, haunted and horrified. </Karia> “What have you done[y][z]?” she whispered, her voice barely carrying over the distance between them.[aa]
        Those words stung. Trent turned away, gritting his teeth and buried his guilt and shame underneath the raging anger inside. Couldn’t she see that he was giving them justice? Couldn’t she be grateful that he was freeing her? Skies! Blast it all!
        Trent rifled through the guard's clothes, searching for the keys. The silence gnawed at his sanity, and his conscience threatened to condemn him. What have I done? His insides continued to twist at Karia’s few words, and his heart felt as though it was being meticulously picked apart by a specter. What have I done!
        Frantically digging through pockets, the oppressive silence weighed heavily on him, a stark contrast to Sibier's feeble moans that pierced the tension. Time was slipping through his fingers, every second a precious resource he couldn't afford to waste. 
At last, his fingers closed around the cold metal of the key. Leaping to his feet, he wrestled with the key in the lock until it finally clicked. Karia, emerging from the shadows of her cell, hesitated. She seemed more composed, but Trent knew her well enough to see the well of emotions hidden below. Deep inside of her, he could still see the enormous gash his betrayal had left on her heart.
 Her hesitation quickly ended, as she launched herself into Trent's arms. Her embrace was a balm to his battered spirit, a fleeting moment of peace in the tempest of their lives. </Karia> “Skies, it’s good to be with you again,” she murmured against him, her voice muffled by his shoulder. 
        All [ab]at once, Trent felt all of his anger, rage, and terror melt away. There was something magical about Karia, and for the first time in a while, Trent finally felt like himself. He pulled Karia closer, welcoming her warmth. The tension in him relaxed, and he breathed deeply, finally complete. 
        Trent gently disengaged from their embrace, his eyes looking deep into Karia’s. </Sibier> “There is so much to explain,” he started. He pointed to Sibier. </Sibier> “I saved him from the Trials, and he needs attention now.”
        Karia, her resilience shining through her tear-streaked face, nodded in understanding. </Karia> “Let’s go,” she agreed, her voice still raw with emotion, </Karia> “but first I need to tell you something.”
        Trent felt his heart freeze in his chest. He knew that tone. Something was wrong. </Ilyian> “What is it?”
        </Terit> “Those guards you killed…” she paused, then pointed to one who tried to surrender. </Terit> “Well, that one had pity for me, and he kept me updated on what he could in secret. He told me Selean is sick.”
        Karia grabbed Trent’s arm, looking straight into his eyes. </Terit> “She has the same thing your brother did, Trent.”
        Trent felt as though his strength had been sucked out of him. The pain of that moment ye[ac]ars ago came back in a whelming wave of anger. He had vowed that day to get revenge on the kingdom. Heavens above, he was going to. He was going to save Selean too. 
        Trent set his jaw, hiding the tears right behind his eyes. </Yorin> “We have to hurry then. Blast it, once your out of here, I’ll search the castle for that blasted medicine. They can’t keep it from me this time.”[ad]
        With deliberate care, Trent hoisted Sibier into his arms, the boy's fevered shivers a silent alarm to the urgency of their plight. As Trent beheld him, a profound sense of purpose enveloped his being—finally, what he was doing felt right. 
        Together, he and Karia sprinted through the corridors. They passed cell after cell, yet Trent no longer shriveled at their moans. With Karia by his side, He felt an indomitable force swell within him, a beacon of light piercing through the suffocating darkness. This unity, this shared burden, it was the essence of leadership, the soul of rebellion. This is what it felt like to be the Rebellion Leader. This was who he was. 
        They burst from the underground prison, emerging from the side of the mountain as though they were reborn. Clouds blanketed the night sky, but moonlight still shone through and the stars were bright. Pausing, they allowed the cool breeze to fill their lungs, a brief respite that was shattered by Karia’s worsening coughs. Trent's concern deepened—a silent acknowledgment of her vulnerability, a rare glimpse beneath the armor she wore so well.
        Heavens above, she needed medical attention too. 
        </Sibier> “Follow me,” Trent ordered. Karia nodded, still wheezing. 
        Veering off the beaten path, Trent guided them through the rugged terrain, the seclusion of the trials' location making it easy for them to become lost. Karia coughed again, and a small whimper came from Sibier. It also meant that finding quick medical help would be impossible.
        Karia's labored breath darkened Trent’s mind, giving him the cold chill he had felt years ago when his brother had that same cough… In his mind, he was transported back to a time of desperate searches for healing herbs, each one a flare of hope that flickered and died in the cold reality of his brother's worsening condition. He remembered how his cheeks stung from the guard’s slap as he had begged for the needed medicine. After, he had walked slowly home, knowing that his brother was doomed. 
Drawing a ragged breath that tasted of dust and resolve, Trent's gaze fell upon Sibier, the boy's frail form a mirror to the brother he couldn't save. The sight of drool, tinged with the crimson of his blood, a stark reminder of the fragility of life, ignited a fierce determination within Trent. I can’t fail again, he vowed silently, the resolve hardening in his heart. With renewed urgency, he propelled them forward, his strides becoming leaps as he navigated the treacherous landscape, each step a defiance against the fate that had once claimed his brother. Lifting his eyes to the heavens, Trent sought solace in the stars, those ancient witnesses to his deepest sorrows and greatest hopes. </Karia> "Help us," he whispered into the night, a plea carried in the wind, hoping against hope for the intervention of a higher power, for the strength to change the course of the story unfolding under their watchful gaze.
        Though instead of feeling comforted his unease grew, feeling as though the night was watching them with a thousand silent eyes. Usually the stillness of the mountain air held a kind of tranquility, but now it carried an unsettling charge. Trent took in a silent breath. The very heavens were warning him: skies, something was wrong. He glanced down at Sibier, then back at Karia: neither were holding up well. But there was something else…
It wasn't long before the unsettling sensation crept up Trent's spine, a divine whisper of menace that turned his blood cold. He halted, a silent command that Karia and Sibier instinctively obeyed. The air felt tight, the quiet of the night unnaturally heavy. Trent's gaze pierced the darkness, seeking out the source of his unease. What are the stars trying to warn me about? 
        Then, as silently as death's own whisper, the Darkened Dawn appeared: figures cloaked in darkness, their presence an affront to the night's peace.  Clad in cloaks as dark as the void, they were barely distinguishable from the night itself, save for the unsettling gleam in their eyes. Their gaze, like a mirror reflecting the raw ambition deep inside, fixated on Sibier with a predatory interest. The moonlight, filtered through the dense canopy of trees, barely illuminated their forms, casting them in an ethereal, almost spectral light.
        Skies, these were demons. He had heard tales of this syndicate, whispers of their ruthless pursuit of power and their unnerving control over the government. He had dismissed these as exaggerated children's stories, but now, faced with their ominous presence, those stories took on a chilling reality. It was rumored that they brokered with the devils from the depths themselves in search of power…
Trent's hand instinctively moved to the hilt of his sword, the metal cool and reassuring under his touch. His eyes narrowed as he took in the sight of the Darkened Dawn, their cloaks drawn tight around them, faces obscured. He wondered how much of those tales were true. 
One of the figures stepped forward, the moonlight catching the edge of a blade concealed within the folds of his cloak. </Terit> "Trent," he began eerily, </Sibier> "the trials have not been kind to your young friend there.” Like a hawk to its prey, his eyes riveted on Sibier. </Sibier> “At long last, it appears Icar has finally found the secret to bring about the long-awaited resurrection of our people’s Heti[ae]."
Trent felt his throat dry, and turned to Karia. Her expression held a mix of determination, weariness and concern, as an unspoken understanding passing between them. </Terit> “Run”, he signaled to her. 
The syndicate member continued. </Sibier> “Your position as High Executioner is pleasing to our masters Trent, and so we will show you mercy. Give us the boy, and we will let Karia live.”
The stars above, usually a comforting constant in Trent's tumultuous life, now seemed to watch in silent judgment: his next words held eternal significance. It wouldn’t be hard to give up Sibier, but in his heart he knew he couldn’t. He wasn’t The High Executioner, but today was the rebirth of the Rebellion Leader. They might all die, but it was the right choice. 
</Karia> “Karia,” Trent whispered, his voice ruff, </Terit> “Go now.”
Karia placed her hand softly on his shoulder, looking into his eyes momentarily, and understanding the gravity of his choice. As she gently lifted Sibier into her arms and turned to flee into the enveloping night, Trent felt a complex tapestry of emotions unfurl within him. There was an ache, profound and acute, born from the realization that he couldn't be by their side, that his place was here, standing between them and the inexorable advance of the Darkened Dawn.
        The sounds of the night, once a tranquil symphony, now roared in his ears like a tempest, each leaf rustle and twig snap a reminder of the fragility of their bid for freedom. And yet, as the distance between them grew, Trent's resolve hardened into something unbreakable. This was his sacrifice, a testament to the depth of his commitment to those he held dear. It was a choice borne of necessity, a painful severance that underscored the stark reality of their situation. 
Snarling, he stared straight into the lead syndicate’s eyes, and drew his weapon. </Sibier> “You won’t touch them.”
The figure glided closer, unfazed. </Sibier> “You know not what you do by withholding our evidence from us,” he accused. </Terit> “Get out of our way.”
Trent leveled his blade to the tip of the figure’s throat, stopping him dead in his tracks. </Karia> “I don’t care,” he hissed. </Terit> “Another step, and I will kill you.” He eyed all six of the Darkened Dawn, a threat in his eyes.
The air was dead quiet. Then everything fell apart.
        The first attacker lunged, a silhouette against the moon, blade aimed with deadly precision. Trent sidestepped, the rustle of his cloak the only sound in the silent ballet of death. He countered with a swift, arcing swing of his sword, its edge whistling through the air. The clash of steel rang out, a harsh note in the quiet night, as Trent parried the blow, sparks flying from the collision.
With no time to waste, Trent pressed the advantage, driving his opponent back with a flurry of strikes. Each movement was calculated, a dance honed through countless battles. His blade was an extension of his will, cutting through the air with lethal grace.
But the Darkened Dawn were not ordinary foes. They moved with an unnerving cohesion and skill that spoke of extensive training and a shared, dark purpose. As the first assailant faltered, another took his place, attacking from the side with a vicious swipe aimed at Trent's midsection.
Trent twisted, feeling the air shift as the blade missed its mark by mere inches. He countered with a quick thrust, his sword finding the gap in his assailant's defense. A grunt punctuated the night as the attacker stumbled back, wounded but not yet defeated.
Knowing he couldn’t afford to let any of them through, Trent fought with the desperation of a man with everything to lose, his every strike reminding him of the hero he once was. The Hero I am now!
Then, with a surge of adrenaline, Trent launched a bold offensive, his sword a blur as he took on two attackers at once. Parrying a strike to his left, he spun, delivering a kick to the chest of the assailant to his right, sending him sprawling. 
The Darkened Dawn, however, didn’t let him keep his momentum. They were relentless, and as one fell, another took his place, a never-ending tide of darkness. Trent's breath came in ragged gasps, his arms aching with the effort of sustained combat.
In a moment of clarity amidst the chaos, Trent realized the futility of direct confrontation. He needed to create an opening, a chance for escape. With a roar that echoed off the mountain walls, he unleashed a barrage of attacks, each more ferocious than the last, driving his opponents back step by step. This was for Karia.
Unable to keep up, Trent made a singular, desperate gamble. Feigning a misstep, he lured the Darkened Dawn's most aggressive fighter into overextending. With practiced precision, Trent pivoted, his sword sweeping in a deadly arc.
The blade connected with a sickening certainty. The Darkened Dawn member crumpled, his cloak settling around him like the wings of a fallen raven. In an instant, Trent ripped his blade free of the flesh, jumping back to avoid the next attack. 
But it didn’t come. The remaining attackers hesitated, their confidence shaken by the High Executioner’s brutality. Seizing the moment, Trent's gaze locked onto the path towards the castle — opposite of the one Sibier and Karia had taken. Without a backward glance, he sprinted into the night, his heart pounding.

Cursed
Chapter Twelve
























The headache was unbearable.
Sibier squinted his eyes, as colors blurred around him. His neck felt as though it had been ripped to shreds, and the taste of iron saturated his mouth. He sat hunched on cold stone, the wind's mournful howls mingling with the sporadic crackle of lightning overhead. Salt from the air burned his lips and the raw edges of his wounds—cruelly gnawing his skin away underneath the inadequate bandages wrapped loosely around his torso. Someone had attended to me, he realized. 
With a shaky hand, Sibier wiped the grime from his eyes, recoiling in horror as his gaze fell upon his arm. Where once scorched scales had marked him, now only deep scars remained… and beneath those marks the purple elixir still coursed, a network of black tendrils pulsating under his pale skin. His stomach hardened, his breaths came in short, sharp gasps as if invisible tubes were once again constricting his throat, choking the life from him. Once again he could hardly breath, the nightmare overwhelming him. Overwhelmed by the visceral memory, he cried out, his body lurching forward in a reflex of agony. Desperately, he clawed at his neck, fingers raking over tender flesh, tearing open wounds that had barely begun to heal. Make it stop! He pleaded to the heavens, as tears welled in his eyes. 
Suddenly, a firm grip seized his arm, halting his frantic movements. </Sibier> “Stop that,” a voice commanded stiffly.
Startled, Sibier froze, his heart racing in his chest. Blinking through the pain, his eyes focused on the figure crouched before him. Shielded from the storm in the narrow alleyway, her red hair hung in tangled, matted locks, framing a face marked by hardship yet bearing an undeniable regality. Her features, though marred by dirt and the harshness of survival, carried the poise of a born leader.
        Sibier's breath caught in recognition—this was Karia, the celebrated second-in-command of the rebellion, a woman whose courage had ignited hope across the kingdom. Everyone knew who she was. 
        Seeing her, however, invoked dark memories of Trent’s betrayal to the forefront of Sibier’s mind. He swallowed, instinctively pulling his cursed arm behind his back, as a coil of distrust tightened in his stomach. What if Karia also betrayed the Kingdom?
        Pain lanced through his head, a stark reminder of his physical vulnerabilities, and he groaned, teeth clenched against the relentless surge of agony. Karia's features softened marginally in response, yet her expression remained guarded, her true thoughts obscured behind a practiced mask of neutrality. Still, she guided his left arm away from his bleeding neck to his lap, then took a seat opposite him, the small gesture bridging the distance between them with an unspoken promise of solace. </Karia> "You've been unconscious for nearly a day," she murmured, her voice low, carrying a hint of something unspoken.
        Her touch, albeit gentle, did little to assuage the turmoil that roiled within him. He closed his eyes, battling against wave after wave of pain, but another fear burned in the front of his mind: was Ilyian safe? Worry clouted his heart as he wondered about his brother, feeling the divine accountability resting on his shoulders. From above, he could almost feel his parent’s dissatisfaction with his actions.
        Heavens above, I have failed! 
        The wind mournfully howled around them, as Sibier bowed his head as deep regret burrowed in his heart. Regret consumed him, his decision to join the kingdom’s militia echoing back as a grave mistake—a betrayal of his father’s legacy and the rebellion he once led. Now, the Sogni name was tainted by his actions. His heart ached with the rest of his bruised body, his wound deeper than its outside appearance. The stars should have let me die. 
        A burning desire for repentance churned in the depths of his soul, as Sibier clenched his fist. I have to make it right. He glanced heavenward, with tears in his eyes and a vow on his lips, renewing his covenant with his parents. He could still save their dream… even with his blasted curse. Giving everything he had, Sibier’s heart nearly fell out of his chest as he beseeched the stars for guidance. Yet, up above, all he could see were tumultuous storm clouds and clashes of lightning. 
        He turned his gaze downward, seeing a soft tear rolling down Karia’s cheek. Her head hung low as she held her sword[af] in her hand, softly running her finger over the hilt. Though it was well worn with knicks and scratches, a few simple words brightly shone inscribed on the blade: May this lead to the stars unifying us for all time and eternity. Her silent tears fell on the metal, and Sibier could almost feel the grief emanating from her. She had lost something too, he realized. 
        In her, he could see the broken person beneath the cloak, the person questioning if there was good left in the world. He could see the person who tried so hard to help, but their actions often made things worse. He could see the person who hoped — who tried to give peace — yet only found desolation themselves. 
        Sibier felt the same way. 
        He wrinkled his nose, as a feeling of duty rose up in him. As though the stars had woven it into his very nature, he felt a powerful urge to help, uplift and inspire. Karia, needed the consolation that Sibier felt that he was created to give. This is the dream, he realized. In its rawest form, Sibier knew the Sogni vision — the Soni legacy — was to lift those hands that hung down. 
        Yet, instead of reaching out, Sibier bit his lip. His pain was fresh, and his parents’ murder remained vivid in his mind. He saw again and again the High Executioner brutally kick his broken mother, sending her crashing into her father. These memories tore through Sibier deeper than his scars from the Trials. How could he help Karia when she was so close to Trent? Trent, the blasted monster who had killed his parents?
        Sibier glanced away from her, a deep rooted grudge crowding out his heart. He knew what he should do. But heavens above! How could he? He wondered if Karia even knew what Trent had done to his family. To the depths with him, Sibier mentally cursed. 
        But something deep inside of him stirred. This isn’t me. This isn’t my dream. This isn’t the Sogni legacy. Certainly, the stars had placed the two of them together — this was something he needed to do. Sibier looked once again at Karia, and compassion swelled in his soul as he watched her lips tremble. Slowly, carefully and almost reverently, she slid her sword back into its sheath. 
        </Terit> “I’m sorry,” Sibier rasped. He had intended to say more, but the rest of the words choked in his mouth. They stuck to his throat like tar.
        Karia looked up at him, her eyes hollow. </Karia> “You should rest.” 
        Sibier didn’t listen. He understood the ache in her heart, and he could help. Skies, he didn’t want to, but he needed to. Even though he was bruised, broken, and frozen, he knew some wounds went much deeper. </Sibier> “I understand your pain—”
        </Sibier> “Do you?” Karia snapped. </Sibier> “Do you know what it feels like to be so close to achieving everything you ever wanted, then have it snatched away from you? Do you know what it is like to lose what you love most?” Her voice hardened, quiet and deadly. </Sibier> “You only live because of Trent’s heart. He put his own family at risk to save you. He never did that for me.”
        Sibier prickled at those words, his body tensing. He frowned, doing his best to swallow his anger, but Karia had struck a tender chord. </Sibier> “Blast it,” he coughed. </Sibier> “Do you know what he did to my family?”
        Karia’s face darkened, and she opened her mouth to speak, but Sibier cut her off. She did it to him; he could blasted do it to her. </We> “He murdered them,” Sibier spat. </We> “Without mercy.”
Once again, Karia’s face hardened as she scrutinized Sibier, her voice cutting through the icy air like a blade. </We> “Who were your parents? Tyrants in the kingdom?”
        Sibier sputtered, slamming his fist down, and squinting through the ensuing pain but held Karia's piercing gaze. </Sibier> “My fathers name was David. David Sogni.”
        Karia recoiled slightly, her eyes narrowing. </Sibier> “No,” she muttered, almost to herself. </Sibier> “He wouldn’t have.” She pressed her knuckles into the icy stones, scraping them until crimson drops mixed with the rain. 
        Guilt twisted inside Sibier, seeing Karia’s pain deepen. He wanted to justify his anger, but a cold shiver ran through him, imagining his father’s disapproving shake from the stars above. His voice wavered as he spoke. </somebody else> “I’m sorry. Forgive me.”
        The wind howled around them, carrying with it the sound of ice breaking against the buildings they huddled against. Karia sniffed, as she wiped away silent tears. </everybody> “You know he is only trying to save his own family,” she whispered. </Someone> “King Icar is forcing him to do those things.”
        Sibier’s lips thinned into a hard line, swallowing the bitter retort that rose in his throat. He took a deep breath, staring at his feet. How could he kill my family justifying it as saving his own? How could any man think like that? His mind churned with rage, struggling to comfort Karia while feeling the unfairness of it all. Anger, remorse, hate — they all crowded his heart, suffocating him.
        Karia’s voice cracked as she continued. </Someone> “I love him, Sibier, and he betrayed me also to save them. He couldn’t let them die.”
        Sibier’s heart clenched painfully as his eyes met Karia’s. In her gaze, he saw a hurt so familiar it almost felt like his own. Trent’s decisions had shattered them both, leaving them abandoned together against the raging storm. Both of them had lost what they called family.
        </them> “Then you know how I feel,” Sibier muttered, his voice barely audible still mixed with grief, </We> “and I know how you feel.”
        Karia’s eyes were dry now, her sorrow etched deep. She simply nodded, the weight of unspoken words hanging between them. 
        After minutes of silence, Sibier spoke, each word more resolute than the last. </Yorin> “And it hurts so bad,” he began, his eyes shining with unshed tears. </They> “It feels as though a part of you was torn away and given to swine. The anguish is so insufferable that it feels like it can never be healed, and never corrected.”
        He glanced up at the stars, his mother’s comforting words echoing in his mind. </Sibier> “But there is more to the pain than just hurt,” he repeated softly. </Sibier> “There is growth… but only if you don’t let it keep you down.”
        Sibier leaned forward, his heart pounding in his chest. </Sibier> “Karia, from this we can create a new community, a place where there is no heartache, no starvation. A place where we can be free and save lives. It will be like a dream.”
        Karia looked at him skeptically. </Karia> “You want to start another rebellion?”
        Sibier shook his head. </Sibier> “No, the rebellion’s fire has been extinguished. But we can create a kingdom where no child hungers on the streets, where no one begs for food. A place where no one hides from the shadows, and where trust reigns.”
        As he spoke, Sibier felt his resolve hardening, his vision becoming clearer. </Karia> “You can make this world a better place, Karia. People brighten when they see you — they rally behind who you are. They encourage your every step, and they will defend you with fierce loyalty. Surely they will come, Karia, and we can leave the tyrants of this kingdom behind.”
A hesitant smile tugged at Sibier’s lips, despite the pain in his heart. Even though he felt sick, he could feel the stars brighten overhead. This was who he was meant to be. 
</Werrin> “How could we possibly do that?” Karia questioned, her voice tinged with doubt. </Werrin> “The people are broken. We lost.”
</Sibier> “You don’t understand,” Sibier answered, his eyes alight with determination. </Sibier> “We don’t have to fight anyone. My father had found a trove of food underneath the islands — we can harvest and feed the people. Those on the streets will come to us, and we will have food and work for them. We can build our own kingdom without tearing one down. That is the vision!”
        </Sibier> “No fighting?” Karia met Sibier’s gaze, her eyes reflecting a spark of hope. </Werrin> “I’ll give it a try.”

A New Fold
Chapter Thirteen
























[ag]
</Werrin> “Si!” Ilyian squealed in delight, bits of unchewed seaweed[ah] dangling from his mouth.
        Sibier ran to his brother, lifting him off the ground with a wide grin, spinning the four-year-old around him. Pure elation surged through his veins, his heart soaring with gladness. With Sibier’s injury, it had taken him and Karia several arduous days to reach the outer islands where he had left Ilyian. </Sibier> “Thank the heavens! You're safe!”
        </Sibier> “At no expense to us,” Terit grumbled, his tone laced with irritation. </Sibier> “The child practically ate the entire bag of food by himself.”
        Yorin stepped forward, clasping Sibier on the back with a cautious smile, his eyes flicking to Karia. </Sibier> “Kid, we didn’t think you were coming back,” he whispered. Sibier sensed Yorin’s growing comfort with him, hoping that the vagrant was beginning to trust him. A silent doubt crossed his mind. Should they trust me, though? With the secrets I carry?
        An itch gnawed deep within his skin, Sibier unconsciously rubbed his arm beneath the coat Karia had given him. Together, they had discussed the dream for hours on end, but both of them remained unsure what Sibier’s curse could mean for them. For now, it was best that no one knew. But hiding that terrible darkness inside of him weighed heavily on his heart: what would they do if the truth came out? 
        Heavens above, he was living proof that someone had survived the trials, and it had left him… unhuman. Doubts eroded his mind, and although he had come to deeply trust and admire Karia over the past few days, there was still something he wouldn’t dare share even with her. Sibier swallowed hard, once again feeling the unnatural pulse in his arm, tingling as though it too was alive. He hated how it made him… made him crave. It tore at him to get more, but he didn’t know what. What did it want? Skies, why do I feel this way? 
Burying these thoughts deep within, Sibier nestled Ilyian to his chest. </Sibier> “I brought a friend,” he said, gesturing to Karia. She leaned against a nearby tree, with one hand on her hip and the other on the pommel of her sword. She had a way to commandeer respect.  </Sibier> “Her name is Karia.”
        Licking his lips, Terit squinted, ever untrusting. </Sibier> “I know who she is. Why is she here? She doesn’t belong.”
        </Werrin> “Everyone belongs,” Sibier swiftly countered, his voice firm. </Sibier> “I promised you a place where no one hungers again, didn’t I? That means everyone.” The trees swayed in the ocean mist, and his words echoed off the nearby canyon walls, carrying a promise that felt as boundless as the sea. At least in this, I can feel sure, Sibier thought hopefully. 
        </Sibier> “Yeah, I was wondering when you would fulfill that,” Terit added sourly. 
        </Werrin> “Well Karia is going to help us with that,” Sibier replied, his voice hard despite the growing tension.
        Terit didn’t say anything, turning his back to them and staring out into the ocean. Yorin glanced at Terit, a frown deepening the lines on his block-like face. Clearly bothered, he turned to Sibier, looking for guidance.
        Sibier rocked Ilyian back and forth, his heart sinking. Why is this so hard? He wondered. Heavens above, he always knew it was going to be difficult to instill hope in a broken kingdom, but did they really also have to be so petty? He struggled to find the right words. Skies, were there any? There was a reason people like Terit ended up on the street… 
        Finally, Karia stepped forward, addressing the two vagrants with her usual matter-of-fact tone.  </Sibier> “Two islands west of here used to be a rebel hideout. It will be an ideal place to establish a new community, and to build out of the ashes of the rebellion.”
        Terit cursed underneath his breath, and didn’t bother to turn around. </Sibier> “I didn’t sign up to join a rebellion.”
Sibier felt his patience wearing thin. </Werrin> “We aren’t starting a rebellion,” he sputtered exasperated. </Sibier> “But we are building a new community. Creating a new district where there will be food and work, separate from the kingdom.”
</Werrin> “So, a rebellion,” Terit said flatly.
        Sibier bit his tongue, swallowing his retort. Luckily Ilyian, oblivious to the rising tension, playfully pressed his face against Sibier's chest and purred like a contented cat. His tiny fingers clutched Sibier’s bloodied coat, rubbing his face back and forth. Despite himself, it made him chuckle. Ilyian always had a way to brighten his mood. Thank the stars for that. 
        Karia rolled her eyes but a small smile tugged at her lips. She addressed Terit more directly, her voice softening slightly. </Werrin> “Terit, this isn’t about rebellion. It’s about survival. It’s about giving people a chance to live, not just exist.”
Terit turned slowly, his eyes hardened with years of distrust. </Sibier> “And what makes you think we can do it? What makes you so sure we won’t fail like that old, blasted rebellion of yours?”
Yorin’s gaze flickered between the three of them, as he stepped back but Sibier stepped closer. His eyes were filled with a quiet determination, his annoyance replaced with a fierce love for Ilyian. </Sibier> “Because this time, we have a vision and a legacy to follow. There’s a secret to these islands, Terit, and I know it.” 
</Werrin> “We will only need equipment,” Karia interjected. 
        Terit laughed skeptically, throwing a rock off the cliffside. </Werrin> “Girl, we don’t have any materials, or tools to make equipment,  people, or even blasted food.”
        Karia’s face hardened. </Sibier> “Excuse me? Girl?”
        Sibier’s eyes widened, anxiety twisting his gut as he envisioned Karia choking Terit. He could almost feel his parents’ disappointment from the stars above: he had introduced one person and already his </Sibier> “community” was bickering and he himself wasn’t too far from joining in. Skies, he needed unity.
        </Sibier> “Terit,” Sibier started sharply, </Werrin> “we plan on getting all of those.”
        </Sibier> “How,” came the immediate, skeptical reply. 
        Karia locked her jaw, raising her eyebrow to Sibier. Do we have to help him? Her expression seemed to ask. Sibier sighed, nodding. They could leave Terit behind, but if they started excluding people, would they be any better than the Kingdom? Wouldn’t they just be creating their own esoteric class of royalty? Heavens above, Sibier thought, I wonder if this dream is even possible. 
        </Sibier> “We aren’t the only ones who know this secret,” Sibier explained. </Sibier> “From Karia’s intel, I believe the Darkened Dawn already knows too, and they might already have the equipment we need. 
        “We are going to get it all by raiding the Darkened Dawn,” Karia added bluntly. At that, Yorin’s eyes widened, but Terit seemed unfazed. To him, it must have been another dream lost among the stars. 
        </Sibier> “And we are trying to infiltrate the most dangerous cult in the kingdom on mere ‘belief’ for likely a lousy collection of ropes,” he mumbled, </Sibier> “great.” 
        Karia frowned, her frustration clearly visible. </Sibier> “Do you have to doubt everything we say?”
        </Sibier> “Yes,” Terit answered, throwing another rock off of the cliff. </Sibier> “That’s all I'm good for.”
        Once again, Karia turned to Sibier, her voice a low hiss. </I> “Why don’t we start the community with somebody else?”
        Sibier felt his heart drop at the question, yet it resonated deep inside of him. </I> “We can’t turn anyone aside; we have to take everybody,” he reminded her, but he began to wonder if it was a mistake recruiting Terit in the first place.
        </I> “That seems like a dangerous recipe,” Karia warned, </Icar> “someone is going to betray you, assuming we even get this thing going.”
        Sibier blinked, unsure of how to respond. Skies, he had never considered the risk of betrayal. It would be easy for someone to turn against them, but why would they? What threat did they pose? Yet, despite his rationale, Karia’s words left a sour taste in his mouth. These days, some people would do anything for simply a meal. 
        Leaning away from Sibier, Karia continued to explain. </I> “It's more than just a belief Terit. The Darkened Dawn has the equipment we need; my rebellion had collected reports of them scaling underneath the islands in search of something.”
        Terit scoffed, his expression a mask of disdain. </Icar> “So they have it. Great. We’re saved,” he mocked, shaking his head. </Icar> “There’s no blasted way we could steal it from them. We’d have better luck spending thousands of years doing our own research to make the technology ourselves. Or maybe we’ll be lucky and find the secret in those blasted muddled words Yorin always seems to quote.”
        </Icar> “They are scriptures,” Yorin muttered softly, but Karia spoke over him. </Icar> “Stop whining. You’ll see how’ll get them. Sibier has a favor to ask.”
        Sibier nodded, kissing Ilyian lightly on his forehead before setting him down. </Sibier> “He’s not going to like this though…”

Sibier fingered the rock, feeling its rough texture rub against his skin. [ai][aj]
        He eyed Captain Werrin’s patrol as they marched past him, and glanced at Karia across the alleyway. She knelt in the darkness, cloaked in the shadow of empty supply boxes, and gave him a curt nod. 
Sibier took a deep breath, silently praying to the stars. The last time he had met the captain it hadn’t gone so well. He inched around the discarded food barrel he hid behind, feeling the brisk wind whip his face. The area reeked of rotting fish, and dull-colored trash littered the cobbled streets in bundles: the results of storm surges. District seven, on the outskirts of the kingdom, always seemed to be the trash dump. It was ironic that almost all of the food for the Kingdom was harvested from within district seven, but none of it seemed to stay. The people that lived in this district were always the first to starve.
With a quick flick, Sibier threw the pebble. Werrin didn’t even break pace as the rock clinged against his helmet, but he took a sly glance back. Their eyes locked, and Werrin’s face drew in a smug smile. He winked and kept marching. 
Sibier cursed under his breath, sliding back behind his barrel. It had been risky to show himself to the captain, but he needed to talk with that blasted man, and yet Werrin had ignored him. Why? Sibier questioned. He had survived the Trials. Surely the captain would want to know how he did it,  right? At least the captain would want to turn him in for a reward?
Taking a cautious glance behind him, Sibier felt his breath quicken. No one was there, but he couldn’t shake the feeling that someone was creeping up on him. His instincts clawed at him, but no one came. Unconsciously, he looked to Karia who met his gaze. She made a tight hand gesture, something Sibier guessed meant to wait, but with his skin crawling, waiting was torture. 
Werrin’s patrol disappeared around a corner, and Sibier’s impatience grew. He glanced back at Karia, who now held her position firmly, her eyes urging patience. A tinge of jealousy burrowed itself deep into his heart, as he again looked to her for reassurance. How can she be so calm? Wasn’t she worried that they might be ambushed?
Skies, Sibier wasn’t sure how long they were going to wait, but Karia seemed unfazed. They needed to talk with the Captain, but wasn’t there a better way to do it? </Icar> “Are you sure?” he mouthed to Karia. She only gave a nod, and the same hand gesture: </Sibier> “Wait.”
The minutes began to stretch longer and longer, and Sibier rubbed his cursed arm. Heavens above, he prayed, let this plan work. He wondered if his parents could sense his discomfort from the stars… and then a wave of anxiety poured into his heart. That feeling didn’t come from him, but from the stars. Skies, something was wrong. We need to go. 
Sliding out from the barrel, Sibier mouthed to Karia, </Sibier> “Lets go.”
        In response, she narrowed her eyes, thinking. And then she shook her head. </Icar> “Stay”, she signaled forcefully. 
        Sibier gritted his teeth, feeling the anxiety only come in a stronger wave. Something was wrong. He glanced down at the empty street again, and his resolve hardened. He needed to take a chance.
Ignoring Karia’s silent plea for caution, Sibier darted out from behind the barrel, slipping into the shadows, trying to follow the patrol from a distance. His heart pounded in his chest, but the thrill of taking action fueled him. He had to speak to Werrin, and he had to do it now.
Peeking around a corner, Sibier couldn’t see the patrol anywhere. The street was empty, an obvious sign of the place's destitution. The guards kept any scavengers clear from sight as few people used these homes anymore. 
Closing his eyes and whispering a silent prayer, Sibier placed his hands against the building, searching for handholds. He quickly found some, and lifted himself on the wall. He began to climb, yet suddenly a hand yanked him back, and another clamped over his mouth, stifling his scream.
        Captain Werrin loomed over him, his voice a hiss. </Icar> “Who were you talking to kid?” He went to remove his hand, but paused. </Icar> “And if you scream, I’ll rip your heart right out.”
        Panicked, Sibier felt a lump catch in his throat. </Sibier> “I was praying,” he said quickly, hoping the lie would stick.
Werrin raised his eyebrows, his attention riveting on Sibier, scrutinizing his every movement. His intensity bore down on Sibier like the blistering heat of the sun, and Sibier began to sweat. This could be a mistake. Last time he had been with this man he had been sent to the Trials; now that he escaped, his fate could be repeated. But Sibier needed the captain’s help. There was no other way.
        Sensing Sibier’s discomfort, Werrin smirked, and finally let him go. He stepped back, keeping his hood drawn over his face. Carefully, he glanced around the alley they were in, searching the shadows. Sibier glanced at Karia, who was now across the street, unable to help without clearly revealing herself. Blast it! He should’ve listened to her.
</Icar> “Did you come back to accept my offer?” he asked, his tone sharp.
        Feeling like cornered prey, Sibier shook his head slowly, mustering his courage. </Icar> “No. I came to ask for your help.”
        Werrin squinted, lifting the lid off of the barrel next to Sibier and peering inside. </Sibier> “I offered you my help, didn’t I? But by the stars above you ended up at the Trials,” Werrin paused, then locked his gaze on Sibier’s.  </Sibier> “How did you do it? How did you escape?”
        Casting his eyes down, Sibier rubbed his arm instinctively, feeling its unholy coldness, briefly disturbed by flashes of heat. Skies, it still made him feel sick. </Icar> “I didn’t escape,” he muttered, </Icar> “I survived.”
        Werrin’s shoulders straightened, his interest piqued. Sibier could feel the captain meticulously studying him. As he looked back into the captain's eyes, he found a mix of compassion but also emotionless duty. </Icar> “The rumors,” he whispered almost to himself, </Sibier> “Do you have magic?”
        Sibier swallowed, intentionally ignoring the question. </Sibier> “I need a favor, Captain.”
        Werrin was silent momentarily, scanning the dark alley. Sibier noticed his hand never left the hilt of his sword. </Icar> “What kind of favor?” The words were slow and measured.
        Sibier’s eyes locked with Werrin’s. </I> “I need your men to steal equipment from the Darkened Dawn and to bring me with you.” Those words came out strong, and he felt a fire kindle inside of him. He stood up straighter, coming face to face with the captain. 
        Werrin’s jaw hardened, as he cautiously eyed the crevice where Karia hid. </I> “What would happen if I said no?”
        </Sibier> “Don’t,” Sibier replied firmly, </Icar> “because we need your help to do it. We are going to create a better world.”
        </Icar> “Kid, I don’t know how you survived those blasted Trials, but I’m not going to help you start a rebellion. You’re too idealistic for a realist world.”
        </Sibier> “We aren’t starting any rebellion,” Sibier answered quickly. </Icar> “We are building a place where no one has to starve again. Skies, we are fixing this kingdom instead of tearing it apart.”
        Werrin frowned. </Icar> “And you are going to do that by waging war on the Darkened Dawn?”
        Sibier drew his lips in a thin line, staring deep into the Captain’s eyes. In the back of his mind, he could hear his father’s words echoing in his mind, over and over again. He trusted his father, but this was improvising — going against their plan. Yet, Sibier couldn’t think of any other way to realize their dream. Heavens above, please let this work. 
        Sibier nodded. </Sibier> “Yes,” he whispered. 
        Werrin took a step back, his eyes widening in surprise. </Icar> “You are out of your mind!” he hissed. </Icar> “Not even the kingdom can regulate them anymore!”
        </Sibier> “Don’t you have a family?” Sibier blurted in desperation. </Icar> “Don’t you want to fix this blasted kingdom for them?” His chest rose up and down in a flurry of breaths, his heart beating like war drums.
        Werrin’s lips thinned as his sharp eyes met Sibier’s. Silence fell, the only sound was the hammering beat of the blood in his ears. He knew he had crossed a line, but he didn’t regret it. Bit by bit, Sibier’s family legacy had been stripped away, culminating in the loss of his parents. That’s why he did any of it — skies, that’s why he did anything. It was all for his family. It was all for Ilyian. 
        Werrin took a long, slow breath through his nose, then exhaled. </Icar> “I have two daughters,” he finally said, his voice thick with emotion. </Sibier> “I give them half my food each day, and still they don’t get enough to eat.” 
        A slow tear rolled down Werrin’s cheek. </Sibier> “Blast it, kid. I’ve spent my whole life trying to make enough to feed my family. But with the Darkened Dawn constantly raiding the fishing holes and burning our crops, there simply isn’t enough food.”
        Sibier paused, seeing the intense love for his family behind the captain’s steely gaze. Skies, his dream was for people like Werrin too. His heart swelled in his chest, tightening painfully. </Icar> “We can get food for your family,” Sibier promised. </Sibier> “But we need that equipment from the Darkened Dawn.”
        Werrin shook his head, defeated. </Sibier> “Kid, it's impossible. I’ve spent my whole career trying to thwart them.”
        Sibier swallowed hard, nervously glancing down to his cursed arm. Doubts swirled through his mind like a tempest, but he buried them deep within him. This was a risk, but he had to earn Werrin’s support. 
        Cautiously, Sibier rolled up his sleeve. Purple light crept through the cracks of his skin, his scars webbing like an intricate map. He flexed his fingers and his veins pulsed, the light flaring with eerie strength. </Icar> “I have something the Kingdom doesn’t,” Sibier whispered. </Sibier> “We could conquer the Darkened Dawn and unearth their secrets. Imagine the legend you would become as the captain to finally bring down their cult.”
Werrin’s grip around his sword tightened, mesmerized by Sibier’s curse.  </Sibier> “Magic,” he breathed, awestruck. </Icar> “They did it.”
        Sibier held up his arm, looking at it with a mix of emotions. Of fear, of worry. Of pain. Disgust. Heartache. Curiosity. 
        Desire. 
        Deep within, as he looked at the power swirl within, he felt as strange craving. A yearning for something, but he couldn’t tell what. It felt almost cold, and unnaturally dark. As his arm continued to crackle and hiss, the nearby moss covering the stone around them shriveled in its light, as though it was frightened by the power. He didn’t know how to control his curse, but Werrin didn’t need to know that. </Icar> “This is our chance,” Sibier said, his voice steady. </Icar> “But first, we need to steal that equipment from the Darkened Dawn.”
Werrin’s eyes never left Sibier’s arm, his internal struggle evident. Finally, he extended his hand, his decision made. </I> “I’m in.”

Worse than Dead
Chapter Fourteen
























Biting his lip, Trent stepped behind Icar’s desk, his hands trembling with urgency. In a flurry, he yanked open drawer after drawer, his eyes darting over the contents. Useless papers filled each one, and Trent’s frustration mounted—time was running out.He had finally slipped past the guards to reach the King’s office before Icar’s arrival. Surely the king kept some medicine here and to Trent it was worth more than gold. It meant freedom. He could save Selean.
But he also hoped there was enough for two. He was going to need Karia’s help if he had any hope of breaking free from the chains of the High Executioner, saving his family, and overthrowing the kingdom. He still yearned to be the rebellion hero.
Karia’s cough chilled Trent’s mind as he rifled through papers, his heart hammering in his chest. Heavens above, he prayed she was safe. Karia was resourceful, and he didn’t doubt her ability to evade the Darkened Dawn, but skies, he longed to be with her rather than be shackled by the cloak of the High Executioner.
Does she want me to be with her though? He wondered. In vivid memory, he saw Karia’s terror as he ripped apart through those guards, her fear when she saw him. Trent gritted his teeth, pushing those thoughts from his mind. Don’t be a fool, he growled at himself. 
Lifting the Kingdom’s ledger, Trent’s fingers brushed against something unexpected. He pushed the ledger aside, revealing a small box with a simple lock. This has to be it! His pulse quickened.
Lifting it out of the drawer, Trent didn’t waste any time searching for the key. Wrapping his hands around the wood, he lifted it high  and then recklessly smashed it against the table. 
Trent winced at the noise of wood splintering. The edge of Icar’s desk had broken off, embedding itself in the side of the box, which seemed reinforced. Desperately, Trent ripped free the wood fragment from the box, peering through the small hole it left, hoping for medicine.
But it wasn’t medicine. 
Instead, he found only another blasted stack of papers, written in a language Trent had never seen before. The characters looked almost alien, completely indecipherable.
Taking a step back, Trent’s mind whirled with questions. As a rebellion leader, Trent had admitted there was much he didn’t know about his enemy, but now he doubted if he actually knew anything at all. Where did those letters come from? What did they mean?
</She> “Heavens above,” Trent muttered. Skies, sometimes he questioned if Icar was even human. Everything about the man was eerie, almost unnatural. Could Icar read this script? 
The sound of the lock turning snapped Trent back to reality. Icar was at the door. Jolting into action, Trent shoved the box back into the drawer, covering it hastily with the ledger. He slammed the drawer shut and spun around, eyes locking onto the broken corner of the desk. Skies, it was obvious.
The door creaked open, and King Icar stepped through. His long cloak shrouded his face in shadows, making him look like a specter of the Darkened Dawn — Trent’s hand instinctively went to his sword. While mysterious, the King wasn’t one to hide, so this… this was unlike him. Trent’s thoughts raced back to the strange papers hidden in the desk.
The King strode to his desk, almost gliding as each footstep fell in complete silence. </She> “I didn’t expect company,” he said, his voice a low hum.
Trent forced himself to stay calm, his mind racing. He had to keep the king’s attention. </Sibier> “Icar,” he said, his voice steady despite his racing heart. </She> “We need to talk...” but then trailed off as Icar’ eyes flickered to the broken edge of the desk, then back to Trent. 
Icar’s lips curled into a sinister smile, his words making Trent’s blood curdle. </Icar> “Indeed we do.” 
Swallowing, Trent watched the King nervously. After destroying the Trials, freeing Karia, and now breaking into the King’s desk, he wasn’t exactly following orders. And now he feared the Icar’s wrath. 
The King didn’t speak as he moved, gliding into his chair with an unsettling grace. He looked at Trent, his face buried deep in the shadows.
</Sibier> “Find what you were looking for?”
        Trent bit his lip and met the King’s gaze. He didn’t dare speak: Icar had his family. He couldn’t afford to make things worse. 
        The King cocked his head, and a purple glow emanated within the shadows of his cloak. Trent’s instincts coiled, but his heart felt frozen in his chest. A pure terror seized him. Something was off. He felt it. Skies, he knew it!
        </Sibier> “No? Pity,” Icar started, his voice dripping with venom. </Sibier> “Because after all these years, Trent, I finally found what I was looking for: a cure. The Trials worked.” 
        With a quick movement, Icar flicked his hood down, revealing his face. Trent’s eyes widened. A new scar ran down from his eye to his shoulders, like a dragon’s forked tongue. It crackled with that same eerie pulsing rhythm, chilling Trent’s bones, and its glow reflected dangerously in Icar’s eyes. Heavens above, the king was terrifying. 
        King Icar stared at Trent, his mouth opening as if selecting words with the precision of a torturer choosing the perfect instrument. </She> “It's painful. Oh, it's so delightfully painful,” he gave a low, hollow chuckle. </Sibier> “You are going to endure Trial after Trial once my men fix your careless brilliance. You will administer them alone, as I can’t afford another accident.”
        Knowing he was in deep waters, Trent hit his stomach, relishing the pain that came from his open wound — relieving him from the condemning stare of the heavens. </Sibier> “As you wish.” Each word felt wrung out of him, twisting his heart as he spoke it.
        Icar smiled, and his scar crackled. </Sibier> “I knew we would get along.”
        </She> “We don’t,” Trent replied flatly. </Sibier> “I hate you.”
        Waving his hand dismissively, King Icar leaned forwards. ”You saw the letters, didn’t you?”
        Trent’s throat went dry, and he didn’t respond. It took all he had not to shiver as fear curled its bony fingers around his heart.
        </She> “They’re from the Heti,” Icar continued. </She> “They are demanding more and more, and we don’t have enough food to pay the monthly tribute. We need more time to run more Trials. And so, we are going to need food to pay the tribute. You are going to steal it from the Darkened Dawn.”
        A small weight lifted from Trent’s shoulders: this is something he could do. There was no backstabbing, no innocent murder, no betraying Karia. Karia could help him with this. Faintly, the edges of Trent’s lips curved, as he gave King Icar a curt nod. </Sibier> “With your men?” Imagine that, he thought.
        Icar smirked. </Sibier> “Take whatever men you need,” he conceded, </Sibier> “I want you to make them hurt. Take all of their food stockpiles if you can.”
        Trent nodded again, still feeling trapped, his prayers for his family’s safety echoing in his mind. The thought of raiding the Darkened Dawn felt like a death sentence—there was a reason the kingdom had never attempted it. But none of that mattered; his family’s safety was his only concern. His thoughts flickered to Karia. Was she safe?
        </Sibier> “I’ll break through,” Trent declared, his voice steady, </Sibier> “and I won’t leave them a scrap.”
        Icar leaned back, a grin spreading across his face like a predator savoring its prey. </Sibier> “You’re terrified, aren’t you Trent?”
        Trent’s silence spoke volumes. His palms were slick with sweat, but he didn’t dare look away.
        Icar chuckled. </Sibier> “Your compliance is a nice change and now we both get what we want: we’ll save this kingdom.” He paused, his tone dangerous. </Her> “Though Trent, I want you to understand one thing clearly: if you do another thing to cross me again, your mother will be first. ”
        Trent’s jaw tightened, his eyes narrowing to slits. The explicit threat ignited a deep-seated rage, pushing aside his fear. </Sibier> “You won’t touch her,” he growled, unable to restrain himself.
        </Sibier> “And now we’re back to how we were,” Icar smirked. </Her> “I won’t touch her, just as you won’t defy orders again.”
        It took everything Trent had to swallow his pure, growing disgust. He had made his choice, but it still made his skin crawl. He took a slow, deliberate breath, clenching his jaw shut to prevent any rash words from escaping. He needed to show Icar he was in control.
        IIcar traced the scar on his neck with his fingers. </her> “What that boy did, no one has done before—he would have died if you hadn’t pulled him out. For that stupidity of yours, I am begrudgingly grateful,”  he said, locking eyes with Trent. </her> “But you will never ever do something like that again. Understood?”
        The intensity in Icar’s words was unmistakable. He rarely repeated himself, and when he did, you listened. With gritted teeth, Trent forced out words he never thought he’d say. </She> “I understand.”
        Satisfied, Icar nodded. </Sibier> “We will need to build off of the boy’s success from these Trials before the Heti feel our tributes dwindle. And you are going to need to find that boy and bring him to me for my experiments. Failure is not an option.”
        Trent closed his eyes, trying to block out the stream the threats Icar effortlessly breathed out. After a few moments, he spoke slowly, summoning all his willpower to stay composed. His throat went dry. </She> “I can’t. The Darkened Dawn attacked, and Karia escaped with him.”
        Icar froze, his smile vanishing. </She> “The Darkened Dawn saw the boy?”
        Trent nodded. 
        Icar swore, standing abruptly and slamming his fist into the table. </She> “Blast the stars above!”  He paced furiously, scratching his nails against the wood. Finally, he stopped and fixed Trent with a sharp glare. </Sibier> “Do you know where they went?”
        </Sibier> “No,” Trent replied, a touch of relief in his voice. It made it much harder for the King to hunt them this way.
        </Sibier> “Then it is in your best interest to find out, is it not?” Icar sneered. He paused, venom filling his tone. </Sibier> “You said Karia went with the boy?”
        Trent’s heart stopped. Anxiety burned through him, searing his resolve. Icar’s fury was palpable, and Trent knew all too well that furious men made terrible decisions. But he couldn’t lie now. His family’s safety hung by a thread.
        But skies, what could I say that wouldn’t put Karia in absolute danger? Wasn’t she family to him? Cornered, Trent finally glanced away from Icar’s gaze, unable to hold it. Solemnly, he answered. </Sibier> “Yes.” The word cut through his heart like the sting of betrayal. 
        </Sibier> “Guards!”  Icar’s call was sharp and commanding.
        Trent’s hand instinctively jumped to his sword, his heart pounding as the guards entered the room. Icar flipped back his hood, his unnatural eyes glowing ominously in the shadows—terrifying.
</Sibier> “Bring Sasha here. We will be needing her.”
</Sibier> “No!” Trent screamed. Desperation flooded his veins as he drew his sword and lunged at the nearest guard. Icar stepped in the way, catching the blade with his cursed fingers, his magic flaring. Trent growled, struggling as the metal sizzled and melted underneath Icar’s grasp. Tendrils of mist curled around the blistering sword, pieces of steel dissolving into a ghostly mist snaking up to Trent’s arm, twisting and mocking him. 
He saw himself reflected in the mist—the High Executioner. A streak of horror cut through his heart, and he dropped the sword. 
Wide-eyed, Trent stepped back, horror, rage, and fear churning inside him. He took a heavy breath, staring King Icar straight in the eyes. </Sibier> “Why are they getting her?” He growled[ak]. 
Icar’s smile widened into a grin, revealing his teeth. </Sibier> “You need a little motivation to do the right thing.”
</Sibier> “If you touch her,” Trent threatened, his voice shaking with unbridled fury, </Sibier> “I will not stop until one of us is dead.” 
Icar didn’t even flinch. </Sibier> “I won’t. Spend the day with her, Trent and then decide if you want her to live. Cripple the Darkened Dawn and find the boy, or continue to fight fruitlessly and watch your family starve. The choice is yours.”
        Trent clenched his fists, a familiar wave of frustration and despair washing over him. Every encounter with Icar ended the same way—with threats and ultimatums. He wished he could escape the endless manipulation, the feeling of being a pawn in Icar’s cruel game. He couldn’t bring Sibier in. The boy’s unwavering gaze reminded him of the humanity he still clung to, the part of himself that he refused to let die. But he couldn’t help but feel as though all of this was poisoning him bit by bit.
Trent swallowed hard, a dark fear creeping into his soul. Who would I be if I forgot that piece of me? A monster? A tyrant? The High Executioner?
        Trent didn’t know and he didn’t want to find out. 
        Sensing Trent’s unease, King Icar smirked. </Sibier> “Save your breath. Spend the day with Sasha— you have tomorrow for decisions.”
        Trent glared at Icar. </Sibier> “You can’t control me.”
        Icar laughed, settling back into his seat. </Sibier> “Control you? I’ve never intended to. You’re too wild, too driven by your misguided emotions. I only want you to see that we’re on the same side.”
        Leaning forward, Icar rested both hands on the table. </Sibier> “I want to save this kingdom,” he whispered. </She> “Just like you.”
        Trent bit his tongue, clenching his jaw in silent rage. His sword lay useless on the ground, and several guards remained surrounding him.
        </Sibier> “I know you don’t believe me, but the Skies themselves placed me here for a reason: they knew that I would do what no one else could. That I would do what no one else would.”
        An icy chill snaked through Trent’s spine, as those words echoed with familiarity. They were as old as the stars themselves. He shuddered, as the haunting words stirred an unsettling resonance deep within him. Skies! The conviction in Icar’s voice made the heresy almost believable.
        A knock at the door broke the tension. The guard opened it, and Sasha stepped through, her eyes a mix of sadness and worry, but she immediately brightened when she saw Trent. 
</She> “Oh brother,” she exclaimed, with her cheerfulness yet motherly tone, </She> “you’ve grown rugged!”
        A rare smile spread across Trent’s face. Somehow, Sasha always knew exactly what to say. </Sibier> “I see they’ve upgraded your wardrobe.”
        Sasha gave a small curtsey, pulling out her long hair in an elegant wave. She wore dark trousers, sleek with their shiny, water-resistant fabric. The clothes were new, and in them, Sasha shone. His heart soared, but a pang of remorse struck deep—he wished they had grown up with such luxuries. Skies, Sasha and Selean deserved that. 
Breaking from the embrace, Sasha cast a wary glance to King Icar.  </Sibier> “We have been treated... very well.” Her tone had shifted, and Trent caught the unspoken words: As well as we can live under his thumb.
        With his head still shrouded in the shadow of his cloak, Icar locked eyes with Trent. </Sibier> “I expect your recommitment tomorrow, Trent.” He ushered them through the door, and it shut with a soft click, leaving the siblings alone. 
        For a few moments, they stood in silence, Trent’s hand resting on Sasha’s shoulder, feeling a warmth he had almost forgotten. Moments ago, he had been ready to kill the King, and now he stood reunited with his sister. The dramatic shift in emotions left him bewildered. Finally, he took a deep breath and removed his hand. </Sibier> “It’s good to see you, sister, truly.” She nodded, and he continued. </Sibier> “But where are the others?”
        </Sibier> “Occupied,” Sasha answered quickly — too quickly. Changing the subject, she turned to open the door.  </She> “Come, I want to show you something.”
        </Sibier> “Occupied?” Trent frowned, resisting Sasha's tug. </Sibier> “Occupied doing what?”
        </Sibier> “Normal tasks,” Sasha dismissed, her voice strained. </Sibier> “Are you coming, Trent? Icar only gave me a day with you.”
        Absentmindedly, he nodded, feeling dread settle in his stomach. He knew Sasha — skies, he knew her all too well. What had Icar done to the rest of them? Blast him! 
        Suddenly, a cold realization gripped him. Trent froze. </Sibier> “Are they being tortured, Sasha?”
        Sasha bit her lip, keeping her face forward as she led him along. </Sibier> “No, it's not that,” she said quietly. 
        </Sibier> “Skies! Icar…”
        </Sibier> “Trent!” Sasha whirled around and pulled his arm, pleading. </She> “Don’t let it ruin today. You need this time to be happy. Your pain is destroying you!” Her eyes looked up at him longingly, begging for him to let it go.
        Seeing her soft expression, Trent relaxed, but only slightly. How could he? Yet his words betrayed a different feeling. </She> “Okay. I will.”
        </Sibier> “Thank you.”
</Sibier> “But Sasha,” Trent added seriously, </Sibier> “I will find a way to get us all out of this and I’ll never let this happen ever again.” As he spoke those words, he felt the same fiery determination that night his younger brother had died. That night he swore to tear down the kingdom. Trent continued, rage tainting his voice. </Sibier> “Skies, one day all those who hurt us now will bow to us! By the stars above, I promise it.”
        Sasha’s smile faltered momentarily before it quickly returned. Her voice was softer this time. </She> “Are you coming?”
        </She> “Yes,” Trent answered. </Sibier> “Where are you taking me?”
        </Sibier> “You’ll see,” she replied, grabbing his arm and pulling him along.  
        Exiting the castle walls, Trent let his skin bask in the sunlight, melting away the frost that had coalesced on his heart. The cool breeze rustled his hair as his boots thumped against cobblestone, his trench coat fluttering behind him. Skies, the wind feels good. 
        Together, Sasha and Trent passed through the market. Jewelry decorated the tables in a dazzling array. Clothing filled shelves, and coal filled barrels on the ground. People parted for Trent, giving him a wide berth as he stalked through the crowd like a predator, prowling in his High Executioner’s cloak. Their fear made his skin crawl, yet he was grateful not to have to speak with anyone. It also gave him a clear view of the food market: the tables were nearly empty. A couple of boxes of dried tuna and a few bags of grain. Skies, in this failing economy, finding enough food for the table was hard for even the rich. He wondered if King Icar was being sincere when he said he only ate two meals a day. Trent scowled, then shook his head. It couldn’t be. 
They neared the tables, and the increasingly desperate cries for food in the market pestered Trent. His fists balled instinctively, his cheeks flushed with irritation. Those pleadings — to the depths with those pleadings! They echoed in his mind, hauntingly similar to his pleas when he needed medicine to save his brother. Desperate, broken, begging. His breathing quickened, eyes narrowing on the crowd. Many offered money—amounts three to four times what the food was worth—and still the merchants turned them down. How much were these blasted men charging? Couldn’t they see the starving people? Where was their empathy?
Trent didn’t even realize he had stopped, until Sasha dug her nails into his arm and dragged him. </Sibier> “Don’t start a fight here,” she hissed. </She> “Come on!”
Trent resisted, imagining how good it would feel like to slug those greedy merchants. Skies, he often imagined how good it would have felt to slug those guards who withheld the medicine years ago…
Sasha tugged harder this time, and Trent yielded. The frightened worry etched on her face melted his heart, as his anger smoldered down to a sickening feeling in his stomach. Something needed to be done. But what? Raid the Darkened Dawn like King Icar suggested? Find and kill that boy?
Were there any other options?
        They continued to pass table after table through the food market, and Trent’s uneasiness grew with the lack of food. Surely there was more than this? He knew the kingdom had seized much of it to keep people fed, and as much as Trent hated to admit it, the king’s tactics were effective at distributing what was available. But skies, he didn’t think the kingdom needed to seize all of it! 
        As they walked, a group of children caught his eye, huddled together, their eyes hollow with hunger. They quickly passed out of view, but the image was seared into his mind. This was his reality—a kingdom where children starved instead of played. He clenched his fists tighter, feeling the call of justice, even vengeance, growing within him. But unable to do anything about it, he betrayed that feeling, and kept walking. I hate myself, he thought. 
After several agonizing minutes, they escaped the marketplace. Crossing over a bridge to the next island, Trent glanced over the railing, seeing the ocean churn thousands of feet below. Its mist filled his nostrils, and for a brief moment he wondered what it would be like to fall. How good it must feel to be relieved from this all. Maybe there was a certain degree of freedom to the depths: the place the ancients whispered as an eternity of drowning, torture, and wallowing in dispair. Trent glanced up at the stars, but they were hidden behind thick clouds. They didn’t shine today. 
Solemnly, Trent shifted[al] away from the edge, slowly following his Sister. She glanced back, her face drawn with concern. However, a slow smirk grew on her lips — the same one Trent knew so well from their childhood. 
</She> “Race you there,” she challenged, taking off running.
Trent scowled, taking another step. He wasn’t a child anymore. Skies, how could he ever enjoy something simple like that again? But Sasha didn’t slow down, and so shaking his head, Trent took off running after her. 
It only took a few moments with the wind whistling in his hair before a grin spread across his face. The smell of sea salt filled his lungs, and memories of their childhood races past the fishing holes and through the forests flooded back.  They weren’t on the outer islands yet where they used to live, but they had gone far enough to reach a gentle meadow with rolling hills. The serenity of the place seeped into Trent’s soul, easing his tension. His shoulders relaxed.
        After nearly ten minutes of running, Sasha finally slowed down, short of breath. Smoothing his hair with his ungloved hand, Trent came up beside her, overlooking the cliff of the island. An expanse of ocean stretched out before them, with islands floating in their majesty.  </She> “Exhausted already?” he chided.
        Sasha punched him playfully. </Sibier> “See,” she snickered. </Sibier> “You look much better now.”
        Trent’s face hardened. He may have felt temporary reprieve, but he could not forget who he was now. He never could. Those shrieks of agony, those haunted wails... those had been by his hand. Heavens above. 
        Sasha sensitively rested her hand on his back, looking into his eyes. </Sibier> “Put it behind you Trent,” she comforted. </Sibier> “Besides, we're here.”
        Trent raised an eyebrow. There was nothing here but a bunch of wildflowers surrounding a large boulder. </Sibier> “Here? There's only — ”
        </Sibier> “No, not here.” Sasha mumbled something underneath her breath. </Selean> “Dimwit.”
        Exasperated, Trent rolled his eyes playfully. Sasha was still Sasha.  </Selean> “Didn’t you just say we’re here?”
        </Selean> “And are you always this literal?” Sasha retorted, and then pointed to the boulder. </Sibier> “Can you push that?”
        </Sibier> “What is this? A challenge?”
        </Sibier> “Just do it,” Sasha sighed. </Sibier> “Do you always question everything anybody says?”
        Trent shrugged. </Sibier> “You’re not just anybody.”
        </Sibier> “So are you going to move the rock or not?” Sasha asked. </Sibier> “For somebody?”
        Trent gazed into her eyes, feeling a fierce urge of protection. </Sibier> “For my sister, Sasha.” Rolling up his uniform’s sleeves, he placed his palms against the rock. Leveraging his shoulder, he pushed, grunting as it grinded against the stone beneath it. Underneath where it had been was now a hole in the ground.
        </Sibier> “What is this?” Trent asked, wiping the sweat from his brow. 
        </Sibier> “What I wanted to show you, dummy. Obviously.”
        Trent grunted in response. </Sibier> “Which is…”
        Sasha clambered down into the hole, and winked at her brother. </Karia> “You are just going to have to wait and see, aren’t you?” She dropped down the shaft, her shoes splashing into the water below. 
Sighing, Trent let himself down, landing beside Sasha. Mud splashed his boots and cloak. He almost smiled at that: it felt good to get dirty, especially while wearing this blasted High Executioner cloak.
</Karia> “Look at this,” Sasha said, drawing his attention away from the ground.
        Glancing up, Trent’s breath caught in his throat. The view was astounding. Before them was the underbelly of the island with thousands of swaying seaweed, illuminated by glowstone of varying colors. The light highlighted the stalks with stunning intensity, as a sea breeze pulled moisture up from the ocean below. Combined together, the sight was unbelievable.
        Rocks crackled as Sasha sat down, hanging her feet over the edge of the alcove. In that moment, she felt like his little sister all over again. </Karia> “It's magnificent, Trent,” she said softly,  </Karia> “isn’t it?”
        He smiled, looking out as the stalks swayed gently in the wind, rocking back and forth in unison and harmony. </Sibier> “Yes,” Trent answered simply. </Karia> “It is.”
        </Stiffly> “Selean and I discovered this before—” Sasha coughed, her voice faltering momentarily. </Werrin> “We discovered this nearly three days ago. It’s been my favorite place since.”
        </Werrin> “I can see why.”
        </Werrin> “Doesn’t this convince you that there is still good left?” Sasha asked, her tone almost pleading. </Sibier> “Doesn’t this make you want to keep going, despite all the malice in the world?”
        Trent remained silent, his gaze fixed on the scene before them. The seaweed hung idyllically, and the sky was awash with the ethereal glow from the stones. But far beneath it all, the ocean churned, roaring with its ceaseless, relentless fury. That would never stop. 
Staring straight ahead, his body stiff, Trent finally spoke. </Werrin> “No,” he whispered, his voice heavy. </Sibier> “Not anymore.”
        Sasha looked up at him, concern welling in her eyes, her earlier cheerfulness fading like a distant memory.
        </Sibier> “If this is all that motivated me,” Trent continued, </Werrin> “I’d step off this cliff right now. This sight is beautiful, yes, but it’s hollow. It gives me no meaning.” He turned to his sister, his voice hardening, the words burdened with pain. </Werrin> “Sasha, this can’t undo the things I’ve done.”
        Sasha’s lips pressed into a tight line as she considered her response, her brow furrowed with worry. Trent’s eyes glistened as he held her gaze, his vulnerability laid bare. </Karia> “I don’t know if I made the right choice,” he admitted, his voice cracking. </Karia> “I’ve ruined families, but I’ve saved my own.” He paused, the weight of his actions dragging him down to the depths like a millstone. </Sibier> “Tell me, Sasha... what would you have done?”
        Sasha placed a gentle — though shaking — hand on Trent’s shoulder, her touch warm and reassuring. </Sibier> “Does it matter?” she asked softly. </He> “What’s done is done. What’s important is that you don’t give up. A wise rebellion leader once told me, ‘You are only defeated once you’ve surrendered your hope.’”
        A faint smile tugged at Trent’s lips at her words, the tone ringing familiar, resonating somewhere deep within him. For a few moments, they sat in silence, watching as the seaweed swayed gently in the wind. A strand floated over to him, brushing his skin with a soft touch almost like his mother did. It was peaceful here, with Sasha by his side, but Trent knew it was all an illusion. Icar had allowed it, and Selean was missing. He had caught Sasha’s earlier misstep, and now it was time to confront the nagging question that clawed at his soul.
        </Sibier> “What happened to Selean?” Trent finally said.
        Sasha tensed up, her body stiffening. </Sibier> “Nothing. She’s fine.” There was too much force behind her words, a brittleness that Trent easily recognized. 
        </He> “You’re a terrible liar, Sasha,” Trent said, his voice low and accusing. </Sibier> “The family isn’t really locked up in their room, are they?”
        Giving in, Sasha spoke quietly, her voice barely audible as it was carried by the wind. </Sibier> “No, they aren’t.”
        A terrible darkness clutched Trent’s gut, twisting it with a sudden burst of anger. </Icar> “Icar killed them, didn’t he? You were going to say ‘before they were killed,’ weren’t you?” Trent’s hand found a loose rock, and before he could think, he hurled it at the glowstone. The delicate lightsource exploded with an ear-splitting shatter, plunging the area into an ominous shadow. </Karia> “Skies,” he cursed. </Karia> “To the depths with this all!”
        </I> “Trent stop!” Sasha cried, rushing to embrace Trent, her voice breaking as the dam holding back her true emotions finally burst. </Karia> “No, they aren’t dead,” she sobbed, clinging to him as if trying to shield them both from the truth. </I> “But Selean would be if it wasn’t for the kingdom’s help.” Sasha’s voice broke with emotion. </Their> “Trent, she almost died from the necfas — just like our brother. The doctors are always with her, and mom and dad couldn’t bear to leave her side.”
        </Sibier> “Why are we here then!” Trent demanded, his voice rising. </Sibier> “We should be with them!”
        Sasha tightened her hold, burying her face in his chest. </Sibier> “We can’t, Trent. The doctors won’t let anyone else near her — they barely tolerate our parents. Selean is already at too much risk.”
        Trent’s fiery anger extinguished, replaced by a cold, gnawing worry that made him feel weak. He had known Selean was sick, but heavens above, hearing those words from Sasha made it feel so real.  
</Sibier> “Is she going to…” He couldn’t finish the sentence. Skies! It should be him dying, not her. Selean was so pure, so innocent. He swallowed hard, forcing the words out, thick with emotion. </He> “Is she going to die like our brother?”
        </Sibier> “The doctors don’t know,” Sasha sniffed, her voice trembling. </Karia> “She was going to die, but then King Icar showed up with this vial of strange medicine. If he hadn’t given it to her, Selean would already be dead.” She paused, looking Trent in the eye, her gaze intense. </Sibier> “You saved her, Trent.”
        Trent grimaced, the weight of her words crushing him. </Sibier> “No, I didn’t. I’ve condemned us all to lives of misery.”
        </Karia> “Don’t say that! Selean still lives!”
        Trent collapsed to his knees as Sasha finally released her death-like grip. </Sibier> “No,” he whispered, his voice hollow, </Sibier> “because now Icar knows that I’m indebted to him. He knows that I won’t try to break you all free.” His voice dropped, heavy with the weight of defeat. </Karia> “Now I have no choice but to go after Sibier.”
        Sasha wiped the tears from her eyes, confusion and fear battling in her expression. </Sibier> “Who is Sibier?”
Trent choked, slamming his fist into the rock with a force that sent pain shooting up his arm. </Sibier> “He’s me, Sasha. He’s the man I used to be.”

Hunting the Past
Chapter Fifteen
























Dressed in all black, Sibier crept across the rooftop towards the captain’s, every step calculated and every breath measured. Despite Werrin’s agreement to help, Karia had remained wary of the captain’s motives, digging into his past with relentless precision. After all, Sibier had already been deceived once by the man—he couldn’t afford to be blindsided again.
As he slipped off the roof, landing with a muted thud behind Werrin’s modest house, Sibier’s mind replayed Karia’s findings. Werrin had come from humble beginnings, forced to join the King’s forces at fifteen to support his family after their business’s failure. His rise through the ranks had been swift and marked by an undeniable cunning—most notably at the Battle of the Ash, where Sibier’s father had faced his ultimate defeat. Afterwards, he was soon named captain of the 7th district, and became someone his fellow soldiers respected but feared. But amidst all the wariness, one detail had made Sibier’s heart stir with hope: Werrin harbored a deep, personal vendetta against the Darkened Dawn.
Sibier needed Werrin’s help, but this time he wasn’t stupid enough to go in blind.
Silent on his toes, Sibier reached the window-sill to Werrin’s home, ducking behind a nearby barrel as a patrol passed by. Breathing out carefully, he peered through. 
Dusk had settled, but enough light lingered to reveal the room inside—a modest space centered around a well-worn oak table. Captain Werrin crouched beside two young girls, speaking to them in a low, soothing tone. On the other side of the room stood a woman with long dark hair, her arms folded as she watched the scene with a soft smile.
As he observed them, a strange warmth blossomed in his chest. It was a sensation he didn’t know quite how to explain — maybe trust, or perhaps even longing. His thoughts lingered back to his mother, who would have been easily able to describe the emotion with some verse from scripture. She might have even called it the sense, urging him to do good… Sibier shook his head. He had never been good at recognizing what was the sense, and he didn’t dare say it came from the heaven’s without his mother’s approval. 
Sibier felt his eyes begin to water. He missed her. She would have been able to discern Werrin’s character in an instant, and tell him whether or not to trust him. And now alone, Sibier didn't know which he should do. He just felt, well, like he could trust the captain. 
Werrin reached into his pocket, producing two small fish. The girls’ eyes lit up as they snatched them from him, looking at the fish with mouths agape with awe. Then, they pounced, wrapping their arms around their father in a bearish hug. Sibier could hear his muffled laughter through the glass, a sound so genuine that it tugged at something deep within him. Once again, he yearned to have his own mother by his side.
As the girls released him, Werrin winked and pulled a small wooden box from his coat. He opened it to reveal only a handful of mashed grain, which his wife eyed with a mix of relief and sorrow. She stepped closer, resting a hand on Werrin’s shoulder, rubbing his back in a gesture that spoke of shared burdens and unspoken worries. The girls snatched the box eagerly, oblivious to the weight their parents bore. 
Sibier felt his throat tighten, his eyes stinging with unshed tears. This—this simple, humble scene—was the embodiment of what his parents had envisioned. A world where families could thrive, where the bonds of love and sacrifice were not torn apart by the cruelty of the kingdom. This was their dream. Sibier rubbed his eyes. This is my dream!
He looked to the skies, offering a silent prayer to the stars. In a kingdom that had lost its way, to witness a family like this was nothing short of a miracle. Werrin had achieved what so many kept only as forgotten wishes—a life of honor, driven by the love of his family.
Slowly, Sibier crept away from the window, his resolve hardening. This was the man he needed by his side. Werrin wasn’t just a soldier—he was a father, a husband, a man of honor. A man who had managed to keep his family intact, even in the face of a world falling apart. He was someone who already lived the dream.  
Silently, Sibier lifted himself back onto the roof and signaled to Karia, who waited in the shadows of the nearby streets, ready to intervene if things went awry or if Werrin proved untrustworthy. She nodded, as together they slipped away into the night.
But as Sibier moved through the darkness, his thoughts lingered on the family he had just seen. For the first time in what felt like ages, he felt a spark of hope—fragile and fleeting, but enough to remind him of why he fought. The dream of uniting families, of building a world where scenes like Werrin’s were the norm, not the exception—that dream was worth any risk, any sacrifice.
And Sibier would stop at nothing to make it a reality. It was the legacy his parents left behind.

Sibier crept through the towering stalks of corn, his eyes sharp and ears alert. Ahead, Karia and Werrin hid behind weathered stones, their forms barely visible in the moonlit field. Sibier’s knapsack already bulged with a few ears of corn—small trophies he hoped to bring back to Ilyian. He couldn’t remember if his younger brother had ever eaten the stuff before. The thought made his chest tighten with both longing and guilt. 
As he stepped through the stalks, Sibier couldn’t help but consider the significance of this field. This much corn could feed hundreds, yet it remained a secret from most of the kingdom—hidden, protected, and fiercely guarded by the Darkened Dawn. It was a secret his father had shared with him in stories, a treasure that could change lives if only they could wrest it from the syndicate's grip. 
His breath stilled as two members of the Darkened Dawn approached, their movements unnervingly smooth, almost gliding across the earth. Their robes, though simpler than those worn by the figures he’d seen before, still sent a chill down his spine. There was something about them—something that made his skin crawl. Unconsciously, he rubbed his cursed arm, feeling the familiar, unsettling tingle beneath his skin. 
Sibier closed his eyes briefly, drawing in a deep breath to steady himself. Neither Karia nor Werrin had known about this place, and it had been Sibier who had suggested this plan, drawing on the memories of his father’s stories. His father had once drawn out plans to raid  this field and take the corn to feed the people—now, that burden rested on Sibier’s shoulders. Yet despite all that, standing here in the dark and about to ambush two members of the Darkened Dawn made his throat dry up and resolve waver. 
The Darkened Dawn members drew closer, their steps eerily silent. They passed by Karia and Werrin, who were crouched low, swords drawn, muscles coiled like springs. Sibier’s heart pounded in his chest, his hand instinctively tightening around the hilt of his sword.
Then, almost uncanningly, the Darkened Dawn halted, glancing down at a vial linked around their belt — the same one Sibier had seen nights earlier. Yet this time the contents swirled together into a dark form Sibier couldn’t quite make out, similar to how the mist rolled together during the trials. It froze Sibier’s blood, as he opened his mouth to warn his friends. But no words came out.
And then, in a blur of motion, Karia and Werrin struck. The night erupted in chaos as the Darkened Dawn whirled around, their swords flashing in the dim light. Their movements had been impossibly quick, as if they had been expecting the ambush. Sibier watched wide-eyed as the syndicate members barely dodged the initial attack, their robes swirling like shadows come to life. Skies, this was going to be anything but easy.
Scuttling through the corn to help, Sibier’s sword caught on a stalk. </Sibier> “Blast it!” he cursed under his breath, struggling to free the blade. The stalk held firm, as if mocking his attempts. Frustrated, he unclipped his belt, abandoning the weapon, and pulled out his knife instead. Stumbling out of the weeds, he cursed his clumsiness—this was supposed to be a swift and silent operation, but now it felt like the stars themselves were laughing at him. 
By the time Sibier scrambled to his feet, the situation had deteriorated. One of the Darkened Dawn members had knocked Karia’s sword from her hand, sending it skidding across the dirt. Werrin grappled with the other, the two men locked in a vicious struggle on the ground, neither giving an inch.
Panic surged through Sibier. They had planned to knock out the syndicate members without any struggle, to drag them away unconscious and interrogate them later. But now, it was clear that the Darkened Dawn had no intention of going down quietly—or at all. They were fighting to kill. 
Sibier charged forward, knife in hand, his mind racing. He had to do something, anything, to turn the tide. He imagined Ilyian back at home, waiting for him to return… he had to return. His skin prickled with tension, his palms slick with sweat as he watched the Darkened Dawn member raise his blade, poised to strike Karia. He wasn’t going to make it in time. Heavens above. 
The blade slashed down, but Karia twisted at the last second, her reflexes honed by countless battles. Her foot lashed out, sweeping the syndicate member’s legs from under him. He crashed to the ground, and Karia was on him in an instant, her fist driving into his face with brutal force.
Sibier blinked, his heart thundering in his chest, his mind struggling to keep up with the chaos unfolding around him. Everything was happening so fast, too fast. 
A shattering crash snapped his head back toward Werrin. The captain had his opponent in a chokehold, the man’s face growing pale as he fought for breath. But then, something horrifying happened—mist began to curl from the Darkened Dawn’s hand, swirling ominously like the cursed vapors that had haunted Sibier during the Trials. Then, Siber saw little shards of glass in the man’s hand and the vial missing from his belt…
Sibier’s throat tightened, his mouth suddenly dry as sand. His arms began to tremble, and he stumbled to a stop, an uncontrollable shiver seizing him. Panic surged through him, his breath quickening, each inhalation more shallow than the last. It felt like he was back in that cursed chamber, the walls closing in, his lungs burning for air. Mom! Dad!  Heavens above, help me!
Dropping to his knees, Sibier cried out, his hands clawing at his skin as if trying to tear away the memories. Get it out! His mind reeled, frantically searching for the tubes that had once been plugged into him, feeding him the agony that now clawed at his sanity. In his desperation, he tore off his sleeves, his magic flaring to life, casting the scene in a strange, eerie purple light.
Sibier growled through gritted teeth, the pain in his arm intensifying as his nails scraped against the blackened, stone-like skin. It was like running a grater over rough rock, every scratch sending jolts of agony through his body. 
And then, suddenly, a divine calm washed over him, as if a voice from the heavens cut through the chaos. Focus. The word was a command, powerful and clear, slicing through the fog in his mind.
Sibier’s eyes snapped open, his breath steadying as the pain receded to a manageable throb. He stretched his fingers, feeling the magic crackle in his arm, the sensation like pinpricks of fire. His gaze locked onto the scene before him—Werrin sprawled on the ground, blood trickling from a gash on his head. The Darkened Dawn member beside him gasped for air, his hand inching toward a knife. But Sibier’s attention was riveted to the figure looming over Werrin.
Its figure resembled that of a man’s, its form shifting and writhing with purple energy. Only its torso was fully formed, the rest of its body trailing off into tendrils of dark power that snaked through the air like a living storm. The figure’s face was contorted in furious anger, its eyes burning with malevolence as it pummeled Werrin, its blows landing with sickening force. 
Werrin tried to fight back, his fists swinging at the creature, but his hands passed through it as if it were made of smoke. The misty figure bared its teeth, a hiss escaping its lips as it struck again and again, each punch sapping more of Werrin’s strength, leaving him weaker and more helpless with every second. His efforts to fight back quickly faded. 
Sibier’s heart lurched, fear and determination warring within him. How is this happening?  The Darkened Dawn member, blood trickling from the corner of his mouth, stood a few feet back, his eyes fixed warily on the misty figure. He seemed to be waiting for something—perhaps for the apparition to finish what it had started. 
No more waiting, Sibier decided. He sprinted toward Werrin, as the ghostly figure continued to pummel the captain, its form dissolving into an amorphous cloud of purple mist. Already, the once-solid torso had nearly vanished, replaced by a formless, malevolent haze. 
The Darkened Dawn caught sight of Sibier charging forward. His eyes widened in recognition, but he didn’t dare move to intercept him. Instead, Sibier cut through the back of the misty figure in a fluid arc with his knife. The blade hissed as it cut through the apparition, its form momentarily dispersing into a cloud before re-coalescing into a more diffuse shape. Heavens above, Sibier panicked. It can’t be killed. 
The specter whirled to face Sibier, its eyes ablaze with rage.  It snarled, and grabbed his cursed arm, its grip agonizingly tight. Pain exploded through him as the sensation burned like fire. Sibier cried out, cursing through gritted teeth. 
Desperate, Sibier threw a punch at the ghost’s face, but his fist passed through it, splitting the apparition’s features into writhing tendrils of energy. The ghost tightened its grip in response, the pain in Sibier’s arm intensifying as his skin began to crack, hissing as it burned. It felt like the Trials all over again—a torment he thought he’d left behind.
As he pulled back for another strike, the ghostly face reformed, its expression of hatred even more palpable than before. Sibier could feel the creature’s loathing like a physical weight pressing down on him. It hated him — Sibier could feel his very soul shiver. 
With a surge of will, Sibier slammed his arm down into the apparition’s elbow. His first broke through the misty substance, shattering the ghost’s arm and forcing it to release him. Stumbling back, his eyes wide with shock and pain, he watched as the specter struggled to maintain its shape. The once-menacing figure struggled to move now, as it sank lower to the ground, the mist spreading thinly across the dirt. By now, most of its chest had disappeared, yet its fury remained as it crawled towards Sibier.
The Darkened Dawn saw his opportunity and kicked the specter’s head, dispersing the remaining mist into a harmless cloud of smoke. The ghost was gone, but there was no time for relief—Sibier barely had a moment to react before the Darkened Dawn turned on him, sword slashing through the air. 
Eyes wide, Sibier stepped back, the tip of the sword grazing his chest. He screamed in pain, the shallow cut burning as the Darkened Dawn pressed his attack, his blade flashing in relentless arcs. Heart pounding, Sibier danced backward, narrowly avoiding each strike, but unable to find an opening to counter. Skies, I need my sword! 
As Sibier darted past Werrin, the captain stirred on the ground, raising a bloodied hand to his forehead, his teeth clenched in pain. The Darkened Dawn lunged for Sibier, his blade outstretched. But Werrin, with a burst of strength, grabbed the man’s leg, causing him to stumble.
Seizing the moment, Sibier sidestepped the blade and leapt at his opponent, his knife slashing toward the man’s torso. But the Darkened Dawn caught Sibier’s wrist with his free hand, his grip like iron. They grappled, pushing and shoving, but the syndicate member was stronger, and with a quick, forceful twist, he wrenched the blade from Sibier’s hand. Blast it!
Luckily, Werrin kicked at the Darkened Dawn’s feet, sending him toppling to the ground. As he fell, he grabbed Sibier’s wrist, dragging him to the ground with him. In a tangle of limbs and desperate movements, Sibier pinned the syndicate member to the ground, breathing heavy.
The Darkened Dawn attempted to throw Sibier off, but Sibier, driven by a surge of adrenaline, batted the man’s fist away with brutal force. Blood dripped from his nose, mingling with the dirt as he grabbed the man’s neck, his fingers clamping down with a savage intensity.  A growl rumbled deep in Sibier’s chest as dark power pulsed through his arm, the haunting purple light flooding the night.
Then clenching his teeth, Sibier squeezed. 
The Darkened Dawn’s eyes widened in terror as he squirmed beneath Sibier’s[am] grasp. An inhuman scream tore from his throat, but Sibier didn’t dare release him. His fingers burned with an unbearable heat as a sickening sensation coursed through his fingertips like venom. The man’s skin warped and blackened under Sibier’s touch, as if being sucked into his palm. It smoldered, cracks and scars webbing through the man’s as it flaked like ash. A sickening realization jolted Sibier—he was killing him. And it felt so good.
A surge of energy, unmistakable and overwhelming, flowed into Sibier from his cursed arm like a dam broke. His chest tightened as warmth flooded through him, contrasting sharply with the bitter coldness of the Darkened Dawn beneath him. He felt… full. Satisfied… yet ravenously hungry for more. His grip tightened, draining the life out of the man.
The Darkened Dawn released a final, unearthly howl, his eyes growing black as purple light filled his veins, the cracks spreading like fissures across his skin. Underneath Sibier’s fingers, the man’s strength drained until it finally vanished, leaving him limp and lifeless.
But Sibier didn’t let go. Pure ferocity surged within him, the glow in his arm dimming as the wind picked up, blowing burnt flakes of skin from the corpse. The man’s eyes had melted into hollow voids, rolling back into his skull. A stark chill shot down Sibier’s spine. I’ve killed a man. [an]He winced.
Frozen there — with his palms still locked around the corpse’s neck — a deep emptiness settled into Sibier. His muscles weakened, his vision blurred, and his heavy panting stilled into shallow breaths. I thought killing[ao] would bother me more… 
And skies, it felt good. The thought clawed at his mind, twisting his insides. He sat there, unmoving, as horror eased into his heart. Heavens above, why do I feel this way! 
With a gasp, Sibier stumbled backward, his hands scrambling in the dirt to push himself away. Rocks scraped his palms and ripped at his fingernails, but the pain was distant, overshadowed by the terror that enveloped him—not because he had killed a man, but because he had enjoyed it. To the depths with my soul!
In his mind’s eye, vivid and unrelenting, he watched the High Executioner strike down his parents once more. His mother’s scream. His father’s desperate plea. Am I any better than the High Executioner?
Sibier swallowed, the color draining from his face. What have I become?
Karia rested a hand on Sibier’s shoulder, but he recoiled violently, pushing her away. </Sibier> “Get away from me,” he screamed, his voice cracking with hysteria. He scrambled away from her, his chest heaving with panic feeling like an unquenchable fire. He felt as though his own boney fingers curled around his throat, squeezing any breath he had left inside. Squeezing out any life. His cursed arm hung heavy at his side, feeling like the very weapon that had been used to kill his parents. 
Sibier’s eyes darted wildly until they landed on Karia, her face etched with concern. She watched him cautiously, even as she helped Werrin to his feet, the captain grimacing as he held a hand to his head. Regret surged through Sibier, and his heart sank like a stone. </Karia> “I’m sorry, Karia,” he choked out. </Karia> “I don’t know… I don’t know what came over me.” Then softly, with his head bowed, he added, </Karia> “I didn’t mean to kill him.”
        Karia offered him a weak, understanding smile, slinging Werrin’s arm around her shoulder to support him. </Karia> “You’re okay,” she comforted. </Sibier> “With Werrin injured, I don’t know if we can take both of the Darkened Dawn as prisoners anyways.”
        Sibier bit his lip, a wave of self-loathing crashing over him. This wasn’t how it was supposed to go. They needed both men alive for questioning. Skies! What have I done?
        Pushing himself unsteadily to his feet, Sibier felt the world spin around him. His disgust for himself gnawed at his very core. Why did I have to keep choking him? He could’ve let go. He could’ve spared the man’s life. Yet, he had chosen to kill him. And for what? They needed him alive!
        </Sibier> “Sibier—” Karia called out, her voice ringing with compassion. 
        </Karia> “I’m alright,” Sibier cut her off, his words hurried, desperate. </Karia> “Let’s go.”
        Karia studied him, her gaze piercing, as if trying to read the turmoil swirling inside him. Slowly, she nodded. </Sibier> “We can at least take the man’s cloak,” she suggested.  </Karia> “And can you bring the other one?”
        Stiffly, Sibier moved to comply, his limbs feeling heavy, mechanical. As he approached the corpse, his eyes were drawn to the man’s ashen-gray neck. A sickening nausea twisted in his gut. Almost reverently, he began to pull off the cloak, his hands trembling as if he were preparing the man to be devoured by the depths, and forgotten by the stars.
        For a moment, he could have sworn the lifeless face beneath him was his father’s.
To the depths with it all. 
        Werrin coughed, breaking Sibier from his entrancement. He had a torch in his hand, its flickering light casting long shadows over the field as the captain stumbled towards them. Behind him, Karia watched silently, her arms folded, her expression unreadable. Werrin stopped a few feet from the corpse, his face drawn with pain, but his demeanor as grim and characteristically resolute as ever. </Karia> “Let's give him a proper burial, should we?”
        Sibier looked up at Werrin, face emotionless but yearning. Slowly, a tear welled up in his eye as he began to choke up. Barely in control, he gave a slight nod. 
        Werrin wiped a streak of blood from his nose.  </Karia> “Whether this man’s ash becomes a star in the heavens or sinks to the bottom of the ocean, he had fought well.” He gestured to the corn field. </Karia> “If you place him there, the stalks will burn hot enough to send his ash heavenward”
        Sibier didn’t respond, his voice lost in the churning sea of his thoughts. He simply took the body in his arms and solemnly walked toward the cornfields. With each step, memories of the night he fled with Ilyian in his arms flooded back. He had left his parent’s corpses with the High Executioner. They had never received a proper burial.
        Sibier’s heart ached as he gently laid the man’s body among the stalks, the once-solid neck now crumbling like extinguished embers. The man’s mouth hung slightly open, as if he had final words to share but lacked the strength to voice them. Sibier wondered if there had been more his father would have said to him, had he been given the chance. More words his mother might have whispered, more wisdom she had yet to share. 
A tear rolled down his cheek, that splattered in the dry dirt below. There were words Sibier wished they had said. He looked to the stars, pleading to have the heavens speak to him. What would they say to me now? 
        Now that I am a killer? 
        He grimaced, stepping back as another slow tear traced down his cheek. The weight of his actions pressed heavily on him, suffocating his thoughts. Werrin moved beside him, tapping his shoulder lightly before stepping forward to ignite the stalks. The flames caught quickly, hungrily devouring the dry corn, their warmth washing over Sibier as he watched, transfixed. His throat tightened, the heat parching his mouth, but he couldn’t tear his eyes away from the fire. The flames licked at the body, their final, consuming embrace obscuring the man’s figure as it was swallowed whole by the inferno.
        Cold inside, Sibier sniffed as he stood there, watching it all burn. The fire was destroying what little hope the cornfield represented. Skies, this much food could save the kingdom—feed families, keep children like Ilyian from starving. But he remained motionless, numb, as the person he had killed disappeared into the blaze.
        How many more people am I killing by letting this all burn? Sibier stomach twisted painfully. He knew what it felt like to be starving. 
        Blinking, he ripped his gaze away from the fire, turning to Werrin. </Karia> “We have to stop the flames. We can’t let this food burn.”
        Werrin shook his head with a grim finality. </Karia> “No, we will let it burn. The Darkened Dawn needs this.” 
        </Karia> “Are you serious?” Sibier’s voice was sharp with accusation. </Karia> “The people need this!”
Without a word, Werrin shuffled over to another section of the field, torch in hand. </Karia> “Sibier,” he reprimanded, his tone cold and unwavering. </He> “Do not question me. This food would never have reached the people.” He lowered his torch to the base of the stalks, lighting them all on fire. It caught too easily. 
Sibier narrowed his eyes, his respect for Werrin eroding like the ash had under his fingertips. This man, who he had once believed might share his dream, was now fueling a fire that consumed not just the corn, but Sibier’s faith in him. But what could he do? He was emotionally spent, drained by the weight of his actions and the horrors of the night. He couldn’t stop the fire on his own, but still! Why wouldn’t Werrin ever listen?
        Karia stepped forward, her voice cutting through the crackling of the flames. </Karia> “We need to go. The Darkened Dawn will see the smoke soon.” She lifted their hostage over her shoulder with a practiced ease, then raised an eyebrow at Werrin, who stood unsteadily, his injuries clearly taking their toll. </You> “Sibier, help Werrin get out.”
        Sibier bit his tongue, the sharp taste of blood mingling with the bitterness in his mouth. Right then and there, he couldn’t have thought of anything he would have rather done.

The Birth of a Tyrant
Chapter Sixteen
























There was no trace of a smile on Trent’s face.
        The chill of the caverns seeped into his bones, as he stepped on jagged shards of broken glass. The Trial control board spanned out in front of him, and every few seconds it sparked, as if begging not to be used again. However, the busted controls had been patched up, the shattered glass pieced together with visible gaps—cracks that mirrored the brokenness of the room, of the process, of the very man who stood before it. The chamber was in ruins, unfit for running trials safely, but to the depths with it all. Safety wasn’t a concern for him. It never had been.
        Because heavens above, he was the High Executioner.
        The man[ap][aq] he dragged with him was barely conscious, his resistance long since given up. His brown eyes were sunken, hollow, as though the soul within had already fled. His skin was scraped and cut as he had refused to walk through the caverns, and so Trent dragged the fool across the stone instead. He didn’t care. Skies, he couldn’t let himself care: Selean was alive because Icar had saved her. And if Trent spared this man — who by the way had been a thief his whole life — then Selean, Sasha and his parents would all die in retribution. And so, in his mind this nameless man was already dead. He was simply toting around a corpse, a lifeless shell that had no future beyond these cursed walls.
        Trent winced at his own brutality. But this man wasn’t a corpse. This man probably had a family. Briefly, he looked down with compassion at the man, and wondered what his name might be.
        That moment quickly passed.Trent’s hand clenched into a fist, and with brutal force, he struck his own side, sending a jolt of agony through his body. The wound from Karia’s knife, still fresh and raw, flared with pain, but it served its purpose, snapping him out of those blasted thoughts. To think of this man as anything more than dead was unbearable. It wasn’t Trent who would kill him. It was fate. It was… he swallowed hard, forcing the guilt down, it was the High Executioner.
        Grabbing the man roughly by the shirt collar, the High Executioner dragged him into the testing chamber. Tiny holes dotted the floors and walls like chickenpox. Some were designed to release the barbed tubes that would deliver the strange elixir, but the rest… well, those were to drain the inevitable blood that would flow. 
Originally, this room had been named as a place of rebirth, but in Trent’s mind it was only a cemetery.  
        The High Executioner shoved the man into the chair, tying his arms together with frayed rope. The bindings were weak, easy enough to break, but as Trent looked into the man’s vacant eyes, he doubted he had the strength to even try. This wasn’t a test. It wasn’t a trial. It was an execution.
Almost autonomously, the High Executioner reached for one of the barbed tubes protruding from the wall, its thin needles gleaming in the flickering torchlight. He pressed one hand against the man’s chest, pinning him to the chair as he jammed the needles into his throat. The man jolted, a guttural scream tearing from his lips as the first drops of blood began to trickle down, pooling on the cold stone floor, ready to mix with the mists that would soon follow.
Devoid of emotion, the High Executioner threaded a network of tubes into the man’s flesh, their needles prying into his skin like hungry claws. The man’s eye twitched as the High Executioner stepped back, inspecting his work. For a moment, the High Executioner stood there, detached, assessing the scene with the cold efficiency of a man who had done this too many times before.
But then Trent’s gaze faltered, the bile rising in his throat as the reality of what he had done—what he was doing—crashed over him. He tore his eyes away from the man, unable to stomach the sight any longer.
He closed the chamber door with trembling hands, retreating to the control board, his head bowed low. Each step felt like a descent into madness, the weight of his actions pressing down on him with crushing force. He took several slow, deliberate breaths, trying to quell the nauseating feeling that churned within him, but it clung to him, persistent and suffocating.
What have I become?
The thought lingered, unbidden and unwelcome, as Trent’s hand hovered over the control switch. His shoulders were squared, but his resolve wavered as his thumb hesitated against the cold metal. He stared into the pleading eyes of the terrified man strapped into the chair before him. In those eyes, Trent saw more than just fear—he saw hope, the desperate kind, the same kind that had fueled his own survival when death loomed near. The man’s silent prayer echoed in Trent’s mind, a mirror of the pleas he had whispered countless times.
Trent’s chin quivered, but he couldn’t stop. Not now. Not ever. Selean’s life depended on it. Sasha’s life depended on it. His parents’ lives depended on it
The High Executioner flipped the switch. 
As before, the Trials started with that same, eerie click. 
Click. Trent’s body tensed as the mechanical whirring started, the noise grating against his nerves. Click.
Click. 
Ominously, the purple mist began to rise from the holes in the ground, crackling as they mixed with the man’s blood. The blood itself began to sizzle and pop, merging with the mist to form tendrils of red that writhed like serpents, coiling around the man’s legs. The man’s eyes widened in sheer terror as purple liquid surged up the tube lodged in his mouth, choking him on its strange, unnatural substance. 
I can stop this now, Trent thought, the idea flickering like a dying ember in his mind. I could end this man’s suffering. But at what cost? Icar had his family. Icar had the medicine Selean needed to survive. Blast it all! Trent’s hand tightened around the throttle, and with a grim resolve, he pushed it up, strengthening the mist that filled the chamber.
The man’s body convulsed, his limbs thrashing as the mist curled higher around him, crackling with deadly electricity. The tendrils of mist burned into his flesh, searing his skin, the pain driving him to new heights of desperation. With a ferocious, guttural roar, the man broke free from the chair, the frayed rope snapping under the strain.
Trent leaned forward, his hands trembling on the controls. He itched to stop the Trial, to end this before it went any further. This man had more grit than he assumed, and those eyes… those eyes held an undying fire that burned with a desire to survive: this man had something much greater to live for. 
Trent stepped back from the controls, breathing slowly. Could I let him go? His fingers drifted toward the hilt of his sword, his mind racing. His eyes flicked to the cracks in the glass that separated him from the horror unfolding in the chamber. Little tendrils of mist seeped through, curling gently around his feet—so deceptively calm compared to the storm of agony just beyond.
But the High Executioner did nothing. Trent’s hands fell away from the sword, his breath coming in slow, shaky gasps. He couldn’t—he wouldn’t—risk it. The man in the chamber was already doomed, a sacrifice to the cruel fate that Trent had become an unwilling agent of.
 Inside the chamber, the man clawed at the tubes embedded in his flesh. He ripped one out from his arm, then another, discarding them to the floor in a desperate bid for freedom. But when he reached the final tube at his neck, he faltered. His hands shook as he gripped the needle, his face contorted in pain and frustration. It wouldn’t come out.
</You> “Skies,” Trent muttered under his breath, leaning closer to the glass. </Karia> “Come on… do it!”
The man stood on his chair to escape the swirling mist building around his feet, groaning as he tried fruitlessly to pull the last tube out of his neck. His body was covered in burns, the skin peeling away in charred flakes, but still, he fought. His face turned a deep red as he strained to pull the final tube from his neck, his veins bulging under the pressure.
But the tube remained.
Trent’s heart pounded in his chest, each beat echoing the man’s futile struggle.  His fingers gripped the control board, indenting into the metal. This man had grit. Skies, I need to save him! But then, in his mind he saw Selean there instead of the man, and his blood went cold. He stepped back from the glass, his breath catching in his throat. Trent had no idea what to do. 
        The man’s scream tore through the chamber, his eyes locking onto Trent’s with a terror so raw it sent chills down Trent’s spine. </Karia> “Help me!” the man yelled, his voice cracking with desperation. Trent felt his skin crawl, but he didn’t dare look away. He couldn’t. He was frozen in place, gripped by the man’s pleading gaze and chained by his love for his family.
Behind the man, the mist began to coalesce, forming the outline of a figure—long, matted hair framing a bruised but defiant face. Trent’s heart nearly stopped as the mist solidified into the shape of a woman he knew all too well. Karia.
        To the depths with it all.
        She appeared exactly as she had in the prison only weeks ago, even down to the hate burning in her eyes. The sight of her, even now, sent a jolt of fear and guilt through his core. The misty version of Karia sneered at him, her lips moving silently, but Trent knew exactly what she said. Why’d you betray me?  
        Those words hit him like a dagger to his chest, but Trent didn’t let it stop him. Years of battle-hardened instinct kicked in, pushing aside his horror. </You> “Behind you!” Trent shouted to the man.
        A puzzled look crossed the man’s face, and he was too slow to react. Karia mouthed more words to Trent, her expression darkening. Now, I’ll betray you. 
        With a swift motion, she backhanded the man, sending him sprawling to the ground. He plunged into the swirling pools of mist, which flared to life with bursts of lightning. The man’s screams filled the chamber as he writhed in pain, struggling to rise. His arm, still tangled in the tube around his neck, prevented him from raising it to defend against the next blow. 
        It hit the man right in the nose. 
        </Karia> “NO!” Trent roared, his hands instinctively flying to the sword at his belt. But he stopped short, his fingers quivering around the hilt. He couldn’t stop this trial. Skies, he couldn’t stop this nightmare!  To the depths with this all! 
        Helpless, Trent watched as the man crumpled, gasping for breath. Flashes of thunder illuminated the chamber, casting eerie shadows on the man’s charring skin, where thin, jagged cuts appeared like the cracks of a crumbling landscape. The mist-Karia moved in again, her form ethereal and menacing, but this time the man, gritting his teeth against the pain, swung his fist with all his remaining strength. 
        It connected. 
        Karia’s abdomen dissolved as the man’s fist went through, her entire form dissolving into swirling tendrils of vapor. Several strands flowed towards the man’s neck, where his skin was already cracked and burnt. The mist slithered through the cuts, and the man leaned back, exhaling a cool breath. 
        Trent went cold. What is happening? 
        The curse began to spread through the man, the dark veins inching down the man’s neck and crawling up towards his jaw. His skin tore as the tendrils of power snaked across him, feeding on his flesh. A twisted expression of joy and pain contorted the man’s face as he let out a bellow that echoed through the chamber, reverberating off the stone walls.
        </He> “Skies,” Trent whispered almost reverently, </She> “he’s surviving. It's working.”  His gaze locked onto the throttle, his hands trembling as they hovered over the dial. He could feel the blood pulsing through his fingers as they rested on the cold metal, as he hesitated only for a moment. With a decisive motion, he pushed the throttle up. The response was immediate.
        A flood of elixir surged through the tubes, and the man jolted upright, his body convulsing as the curse spread like wildfire. The elixir hissed as flowed through the needles into his skin, and excess liquid squirted from the needles pouring into the holes dotting the chamber floor. The mist, alive with a malevolent energy, swirled faster and faster, electricity crackling in the air.
        And then, Karia reappeared. Her face twisted into an expression of pure rage as she delivered a brutal blow, knocking the man off his feet and sending him crashing to the ground.
        </She> “No!” Trent shouted, his voice cracking with the force of his frustration. They were so close. The curse had spread down to the man’s upper chest. It nearly enveloped his whole body — hopefully then, what Icar had called the </She> “resurrection” would be complete. 
His hand tightened around the throttle, craving to increase the Trial’s intensity even more. But deep inside, the remnants of his old self squirmed in protest, begging him to stop and save the man before it was too late. But the High Executioner—the part of him that he had become—silenced those pleas with cold, ruthless logic. Selean needed this. His family needed this.
Karia’s phantom form snarled at Trent, her eyes filled with a darkness that seemed to pull the very light from the room. She lunged at the man, slamming her fist into his nose with a sickening crunch. Agony twisted inside Trent as the man tried to raise his arms to block the relentless assault, but Karia—this twisted, nightmarish version of her—was too skilled, too fast. She dodged his feeble attempts at defense and swept his legs out from under him, sending him sprawling. </She> “Are you going to try to save him like you saved Icar?”  
A torrent of guilt flooded over Trent. In the back of his mind he could still see Karia’s stunned anguish as he leapt in front of her knife, hurt by his betrayal. Trent’s shoulders slumped. I need to do something. He didn’t know if he could cause that hurt in Karia again.
Trent’s eyes darted around the room, as his grip loosened around the controls. He could break in. He could save him. But the cost... If he did that, the Trials would never be completed. This man was so blasted close. Yet, if he allowed the Trial to continue, Karia’s specter might kill him before the transformation finished anyways. And heavens above, he knew her better than anyone. She could do it. This was a living nightmare. 
Karia turned to Trent, her eyes hollow, voids of swirling darkness. In them, he saw nothing—no fear, no anger, no sadness. She was a shell, a reflection of the emptiness that gnawed at his own soul. It was like looking into a mirror, into the abyss that he had become. The High Executioner stared back at her, at himself, and for a brief moment, he couldn’t breathe.
Karia’s lips moved silently, but Trent heard her words as clearly as if they were whispered directly into his ear, twisted and haunting: </She> “This is for your own good, love.”
The words ignited something within him—a desperate, all-consuming need to take control—snapping him into action. The High Executioner roared, a sound of pure, unfiltered agony and rage. His hand crushed the throttle, slamming it forward with all the strength he could muster. The machine squealed in protest as the dial raced past the limits Icar had warned him never to cross. It screeched as it hit the maximum, the metal straining under the force. But Trent didn’t stop. He couldn’t. His hand kept pushing until the throttle snapped free from the control board, leaving him holding the broken handle.
There was no stopping the Trials now.
The chamber erupted into chaos as the mist thickened, swirling violently around the man’s contorted body. Lightning flashed in erratic, jagged bursts, casting harsh shadows across the room. A flood of purple fluid surged through the tubes, overwhelming the system. Detached tubes whipped around the chamber, spewing elixir like venom from a serpent’s fangs. The tube embedded in the man’s neck went taut, and he let out a raw, guttural scream.
The lightning, ravenous and unrelenting, scorched his flesh, charring it into blackened ash. Beneath the searing pain, something monstrous was happening. His skin began to glow with a deep, unnatural purple as if it had become glowstone. His eyes shone with the same dark hue, the veins in his face bulging as the cracks in his skin spread downward—from his neck to his chest, his legs, and finally, his feet. 
He clawed at his face, his scream splitting the air like a thunderclap, a sound so bloodcurdling it seemed to cut through Trent’s very soul. Elixir, now tainted with blood, oozed out of his pores, mingling with sweat in a sickening display of human fragility. Most unnervingly, however, the mist began to swirl through him as he became the epicenter of the storm. He was its heart, its source, its master.
Karia’s misty form ceased her assault. Instead, she hovered nearby, her expression shifting into a sly smile. She stared directly at Trent, her gaze unflinching, her eyes piercing through the chaos with a knowing calmness. 
I’m killing the man, Trent realized, a cold certainty settling over him. But skies, the Trials were working. A part of him screamed to break through the glass, to save the man from this torment. But that voice—of compassion, of humanity—was shackled by Icar’s threats. Yet, there was another part of him— a darker and more twisted version of himself—that yearned to watch the transformation succeed at any cost. That part of him was free.
Ignoring the shrieks that filled the chamber, the High Executioner moved with a frenzied determination. He twisted knobs and flipped switches with ruthless precision, diverting heat away from the glowstone to generate more power. As a result, the lights in the chamber began to dim, plunging the room into near darkness, but the man’s unnatural purple glow kept him visible. 
As Trent turned a different knob, he redirected the remaining heat into the mist, intensifying its fury. The man’s agonized face was illuminated in flashes of lightning, the purple light revealing every detail of his suffering. He scratched at his skin, his back arching grotesquely as more mist flooded into his body, overwhelming him. And despite it all, the man survived. 
This might work. 
But at what cost? This isn’t humane? The High Executioner didn’t pay any attention to those thoughts. Instead, his hand remained steady on the dial, his expression grim and unyielding. The scene only worsened, as Karia’s mistly form was pulled towards the man, sucked into the vortex he was becoming. Her gaze, however, remained locked onto Trent, and her smile never wavered.
Snarling, the High Executioner flipped off the first of three coolants, diverting its power to the Trials. His eyes narrowed as the man writhed on the floor, his skin now nearly translucent from the sheer force of the power coursing through him. The mist moved through him with increasing ease, dragging his trembling body across the chamber as it flowed in a relentless, circular motion.
The High Executioner flipped off the second coolant, and turned up the dial for the trials even more — nearly to its maximum. Karia’s form was disintegrating rapidly, her essence being consumed by the storm. She struggled to maintain her shape, but the pull of the mist was too strong. She was being drawn into the man who was now the eye of the storm, a monstrous fusion of man and mist. Her gaze remained fixed on Trent, her eyes filled with a sorrowful accusation that characterized his nightmares.
Karia’s silent words echoed in Trent’s mind, each one laced with a haunting, unbearable pain. Why, Trent? I trusted you!” Her face, contorted in pleading agony, was seared into his memory — the same face she had that night. Once again, Trent relived the absolute pain he had felt that moment he had chosen to save Icar. That moment he had betrayed her.  </She> “I… I loved you! Why did you betray me?”
Trent’s heart went cold. His hand found the final switches, his resolve hardening as the weight of her words crushed down on him. He flipped off the last coolant. Then, with unholy determination, he flipped off everything except the Trials. The room’s temperature began to rise, a suffocating heat that matched the turmoil inside him.
His fingers trembled as they found the dial, but there was no hesitation as he turned it the rest of the way.
Immediately, the instruments in front of him began to burn his hands, the heat searing his skin as the cooling systems failed. All the lights on the control board blinked out. Metal shrieked as it grinded metal, the sound of the Trials tearing themselves apart. 
Trent’s breath caught in his throat as he watched the spectacle unfold. Flashes of lightning illuminated the scene in harsh, staccato bursts, casting monstrous shadows on the walls. The mist, now a churning maelstrom, tore through the man, twisting his flesh into something otherworldly—a purple film that shimmered and writhed like a living nightmare.
Across the room, Karia’s spectral face lingered for a moment longer, her expression locked in an eternal plea. And then, with a final, agonizing pull, the mist consumed her, dragging her into oblivion.
The man’s screams abruptly cut off. His eyes rolled back into his head. The torrential mist halted. His glow disappeared. The chamber fell into deathly silence. Everything stopped.
The High Executioner stilled, his heart frozen in his chest. 
With unmistakably horror, he now watched the twitching fingers of the man’s corpse. 
</Sibier> “What have I done?”[ar][as]
________________
Secrets of the Night
Chapter [at]Seventeen
























The torches on the wall flickered with a steady, calming hum, their soft crackle pushing away Sibier’s residual unease. He stared down at his hands, watching them tremble ever so slightly. His palms felt cold, but the memory of heat still lingered—of flesh burning beneath his fingertips, of the look in that Darkened Dawn member’s eyes. Fear. Raw, desperate fear.
Siber had killed him. 
Skies.  
He shook his head, trying to dispel the thoughts. High in the mountains, nestled within an old rebellion base carved into a wide alcove, Karia stood beside him, watching silently as the captured Darkened Dawn member stirred in his restraints. Sibier remained motionless at her side, his skin tingling with a strange, unsettling energy. Earlier, they had taken Werrin back to his home. The captain had hobbled through the door, his daughters rushing to greet him with cries of </Karia> “Papa!” Their small arms wrapped tightly around him, his wife following closely behind, carefully tending to his wounds with the kind of tenderness Sibier remembered from his own mother.
Usually, scenes like that would have stirred something warm inside Sibier — a reminder of why he fought, why this dream mattered. But tonight, all he felt was cold numbness. 
He shifted his gaze toward the valley below. Even from here, he could still see the smoke curling into the sky, a dark plume that marred the otherwise peaceful night. The fire had consumed everything—thousands of pounds of food pointlessly destroyed in mere hours. Tiny flakes of ash drifted through the air, carried on the stilling wind like ghostly reminders of what had been lost.
Sibier’s stomach churned, his heart heavy. Feeding the hungry had been part of his family’s dream for as long as he could remember. And yet... this? This was the opposite. He had stood there, watching as Werrin set fire to the fields. Thousands of pounds of food, gone.
He wanted to scream. So what if the food never reached all the people? Didn’t the Darkened Dawn deserve to eat too? Heavens above, he didn’t care what they had done — destroying all that food felt wrong. 
His throat tightened, and he swallowed hard, his eyes stinging from more than just the smoke. </Karia> “I’m sorry, Father,” he whispered, his voice barely audible. The plume of smoke rose high into the night sky, as if reaching for the stars themselves. Could the whole kingdom see it? Would those who were starving see that smoke and know their hopes were burning with it?
For a moment, he glanced up at the heavens, seeking some sort of solace in the stars. But tonight, the stars were silent. No guiding light. No whispered comfort. Just the rising smoke, colored pink by the faint glow of the dying fire below.  
The silence only made Sibier feel emptier. 
How am I supposed to have the strength for this? His shoulders were tense, tight with frustration, and his chest ached with the weight of it all. After everything — after his family’s deaths, after the trials, after the fire — what had he achieved? Nothing but ash. Aren’t the stars supposed to guide me? But instead, they had stood by while his family was murdered. They had watched as he was dragged into the Trials, cursed, and forced to kill. And now, they had let him burn the food that could have saved so many. </Sibier> “To the depths with it all,” Sibier cursed.
The stars weren’t guiding him; they were pulling him further away. It almost felt as though they were his enemy…
Sibier’s gaze drifted upward to the sky, searching for answers among the distant lights and for once, he could no longer imagine his parents there. The ancient texts taught that the heavens would make all things work for good, for those who turned their hearts to their fathers. But what good could possibly come from this? His family was gone. He was cursed. And now, he had killed a man. 
His throat tightened as he bit down on his lip, forcing his eyes back to the burning flames in the distance. The smoke still rose, carrying with it the promise of wasted potential. And yet... despite the crushing weight of failure, one thought pierced through the fog of his mind.
He couldn’t give up. Not now. Not ever.
Sibier drew in a long, steady breath, letting his shoulders rise and fall as he exhaled. He glanced toward Ilyian’s sleeping form in the corner of the alcove. If nothing else, he owed the boy a future. A better world. One where food wasn’t a weapon, and lives weren’t bartered like currency.
 With his mind sharpened, he turned back to the captured Darkened Dawn member. The man’s head hung low, his face slack and dazed, but he was starting to stir. Karia had tied him securely to a chair, and now she stood in front of him, watching patiently, a knife glinting in her hand as she inspected its edge before casually sheathing it.
Finally, the man’s eyes fluttered open, taking in the room in a confused daze. His gaze stopped when it landed on the knife at Karia’s side, and a flicker of fear rippled through him.
 
Sibier frowned, recognizing that look—that kind of fear. It was the same dread he had felt waking up in Werrin’s cell. He guessed this Darkened Dawn member wasn’t much older than him.
</Karia> “What are you going to do with me?” he asked, his voice cracking as he spoke. 
</Karia> “We’re going to let you go,” Sibier said, the words slipping out before he could stop them. Karia shot him a sharp glance, her eyebrows raised, but said nothing. Sibier ignored the look — those words had felt right. 
The man didn’t relax. </Karia> “In exchange for what?”
</Karia> “Nothing,” Sibier answered, his tone steady, and it was true. Right now, he didn’t want anything from this man. He only wanted to let him go, as if it could pay some kind of penance he owed for killing a man and burning so much food.
The Darkened Dawn member stared at him, clearly caught between disbelief and hope. He looked to Karia, who hadn’t moved, and then back to Sibier, uncertain of what to make of this strange turn.
Before Sibier could say anything more, Karia grabbed him roughly by the arm and yanked him away from the prisoner, her face tight with frustration. She pulled him aside, out of earshot, her voice a fierce whisper.
</Karia> “What are you doing?” she hissed.
</Karia> “Being humane,” Sibier said, almost defensively, but it wasn’t enough. Even to him, the words felt inadequate. Shallow. His skin still burned with the memory of killing that other man, the heat of it clinging to him like an unforgivable sin. He wasn’t sure if he was being </Karia> “humane” or just trying to wash the blood from his hands.
Exasperated, Karia dug her nails into Sibier’s skin.  </Karia> “Humane? We’re not here to coddle them, Sibier. These people are dangerous. If you let him go, what’s to stop him from running back to the Darkened Dawn and telling them exactly where we are?”
</I> “I don’t care,” Sibier snapped, his voice harsher than he meant. He saw surprise in Karia’s eyes, but he pushed on. </I> “Skies! This is not how we are supposed to be building a better world! What’s the point of all this if we’re no better than them?”
Karia studied him, her expression unreadable. Then, slowly, she released his arm, letting her hand drop to her side. </Karia> “And if he betrays us? If this humane gesture gets us all killed?” Her voice was quieter now, but the edge was still there—sharp, like the knife she carried.
Sibier looked away, back toward the prisoner, who still watched them with wide, uncertain eyes. His heart pounded, and doubt gnawed at the edges of his resolve. He could hear the question in Karia’s voice, but more than that, he could hear it in his own mind.
What if this was a mistake?
What if the stars really weren’t guiding him?
Sibier clenched his fists, the ache in his chest growing heavier. He didn’t have the answers. He didn’t know if this was right. But he had to believe there was a different way, a better way. If not, then when had he let his hope die? When had he let his family’s legacy become forgotten?
</Karia> “I don’t know, Karia,” he admitted quietly. </Sibier> “I don’t know if this will work. But I can’t keep living like this.” 
His words hung in the air, harrowed by his memories. The fear. The confinement. The helplessness. </Sibier> "Do you know how terrifying it is to be a prisoner?" he asked, his voice strained. </Karia> "He's afraid, Karia. Just like I was."
A heavy silence settled between them, the kind that felt loaded with an unspoken decision, waiting to tip one way or the other. Karia’s gaze softened, just for a moment, but her resolve remained unshaken. She had always been better at hiding what she felt, Sibier thought, if she felt anything at all.
Then, her expression hardened once more, a familiar steel sharpening her features. </Sibier> “We have to do it, Sibier,” she said, her voice firm, final. </Karia> “I don’t like it, but we don’t have a choice.”
</Sibier> “No we don’t—” 
</Karia> “Yes, we do,” Karia insisted, her tone sharp. She moved to step around him, heading back toward the prisoner, but Sibier—surprising even himself—stepped into her path, blocking her way. There was a strange detachment inside him, a numbness that dulled his emotions, but something deep inside refused to let her go through with this.
</Sibier> “I won’t do it,” Sibier began, his voice steady though cold sweat ran down his back, </Sibier> “It’s not who I am”
Karia’s eyes flashed with frustration, and without a word, she shoved him aside. The force of it sent him stumbling back, and for a brief, jarring moment, he felt like the scared, broken child he had been when the guards would systematically punish him. He felt small. Powerless. A surge of anger flared in his heart, mixing with the heat of humiliation.
Glaring, Sibier watched Karia march to the prisoner, her expression set in stone. </Karia> “We will let you go,” she said, </Karia> “but we need you to talk.”
The man, though tied to the chair, lifted his chin with a false bravado. </Sibier> “You won’t get me to share anything,” he shot back, his voice laced with defiance yet also quivered.
Remaining where Karia had left him, Sibier crossed his arms in frustration. I’m not trying to get you to do anything! He thought bitterly. She is. The entire situation made him feel sick—like he was betraying himself, betraying the very principles he had vowed to hold on to. He could still remember the way the shackles had bit into his skin when Werrin had imprisoned him, how cold and isolated he had felt. The last thing Sibier wanted was to subject someone else to that same torment.
Naively, he found himself wishing the man would just give them the information they needed—how to break into the Darkened Dawn’s storehouse, how to steal the food, how to make this all end. He just wanted to be done with it.
But Karia wasn’t giving the man any room to escape. She smiled at his resistance, though it was more of a predator’s smile than one of amusement. </Sibier> “That’s just fine,” she said smoothly, bluffing without hesitation. </Karia> “We already know everything you know.”
The man narrowed his eyes in suspicion, but Karia pressed on, unfazed.
</Werrin> “We’ve been following you for weeks,” she lied. </Sibier> “That’s how we found you and your partner alone tonight.”
Sibier saw confusion cross the prisoner’s face, and it made his stomach churn. The manipulation, the detached calculation—it was too familiar. It reminded him of Werrin, of the way the captain had twisted the truth to get what he wanted, regardless of who got hurt in the process.
Karia continued, relentless. </Karia> “We know your schedule. Your meetings. Your contacts in the Darkened Dawn. We know about your parents, your siblings, and even about the girl you want to court.”
At this, the prisoner swallowed dryly, his bravado faltering. His eyes widened, betraying his fear.
Karia leaned in closer, her face mere inches from his, and Sibier shuddered at the intensity in her expression. It was too much like the High Executioner—the way he had loomed over him in that cursed chamber, the way he had taken pleasure in the suffering of others. For a moment, it felt like the two weren’t so different after all.
</His> “There’s just one thing we don’t know,” Karia whispered in his ear. </Werrin> “You’ll tell us, and we’ll let you go.”
Petrified, the man didn’t move, his gaze locked in place. Sibier wondered if the skies were quiet to him too. 
</He> “Let’s start with the Trials to catch you up,” Karia began, her voice calm and controlled, as if discussing the weather. </He> “Have you heard about the boy?”
The Darkened Dawn member nodded slowly. </He> “You mean the rumors? The boy who survived? The one we’re supposed to catch for tribute?”
Catch? Sibier thought, confused. Tribute? Tribute for who? 
Karia gave a measured nod. </Werrin> “Yes, that’s right. And you’ve heard that they plan to take him to them as well?” Her tone was casual, almost dismissive, but Sibier could see the intent behind her eyes. She was probing, pulling at threads, trying to weave a story that the prisoner would fall for.
The Darkened Dawn frowned, his suspicion evident as he studied her. Sibier couldn’t help but wonder if the man had already guessed at Karia’s game.
</Werrin> “We found a way to traverse the depths?” the prisoner asked, sounding genuinely surprised. </Werrin> “I thought... they always came to us.”
Questions began to whirl through Sibier’s mind. Traverse the depths? That was impossible. The depths were nothing but ancient myths and ocean — nothing existed past the islands of the kingdom. Only ancient scripture spoke of purple demons who lived in the abyss — creatures that feed on souls — but that was at most unrealistic imagery. Yet, the Darkened Dawn didn’t appear unserious: Sibier’s hair stood on its end.
Karia waved her hand dismissively, as if the man’s shock was irrelevant. </The Darkened Dawn> “I wouldn’t expect you to know that. After all, our spies never reported you in any of the inner-circle meetings. Anyways, at the tip of the Island Esther[au] reaches into the depths. It didn’t take long for the Darkened Dawn to find a way down.”
Sibier glanced at her, startled by the audacity of her claim. Surely, the Darkened Dawn wouldn’t believe that. That was ludicrous. 
The prisoner’s face paled slightly, and for the first time, Sibier saw the fear begin to drain from his eyes—replaced by something more dangerous: belief. He actually believes her. Sibier bit his lip, unsure to be relieved that they were getting the information so easily, or disgusted by Karia’s manipulation. 
Karia continued, her voice calm but forceful. </Werrin> “Your leader was the first to do it.”
</Werrin> “Orion?” The prisoner muttered surprised. 
Karia rolled her eyes, feigning that her patience was thinning. </Werrin> “Stop wasting my time with your ignorance. No, the leader of the Darkened Dawn.”
</Werrin> “Oh,” the man said, sounding genuinely disheartened by the correction. But he still didn’t give them the name of the Darkened Dawn’s leader. Sibier wondered if knowing the name would even matter. Would it change anything? Would it bring back the food they had burned? The man he had killed?
Out of the corner of his eye, Sibier saw the smoke still rising high into the night sky, thick and dark, blotting out the stars. He felt his shoulders tense, his insides screaming at him to stop this, to let the prisoner go. Yet, a darker feeling emanated from his cursed arm, as it vibrated with dark power, infecting Sibier with an urge to harm. It was overwhelming.
He clenched his eyes shut, horrified by the sensation. What’s happening to me? His stomach churned, nausea threatening to overtake him as he fought against the bloodthirsty desire that pulsed in his arm. It wanted to kill. It craved it.
The room around him blurred as Karia’s voice droned on, but Sibier couldn’t focus. He turned away from the scene, gripping his arm tightly in an attempt to quiet the trembling. However, the desire — that unholy thirst — subsided slowly, leaving him only feeling cold and empty.
He glanced up at the sky, but with the smoke choking the air, barely any light shone through. The stars, which had once offered him comfort, felt distant now—aloof, indifferent. Why have you forsaken me? he accused. 
He waited. Waited for some kind of response, some sign that the stars were still watching over him. But the silence stretched on, either unaware or unforgiving.
The ancient scripts often spoke about keeping an open mind, and Sibier knew firsthand answers often came when the recipient was ready for it. Maybe that’s my problem, Sibier thought bitterly. Maybe I’m not ready for their guidance. Maybe I’m missing something.
But a darker thought gnawed at the edges of his consciousness. Or maybe, he wondered, they’ve abandoned me altogether.
His parents had been deeply religious, and the skies knew they’d seen their share of miracles. Unexplainable things. Acts of mercy from the stars that defied reason. But none of it convinced Sibier anymore. Why didn’t those miracles happen now, when he needed them the most? Why didn’t the stars intervene before they dragged him into the Trials? Why did they let him kill that man?
Sitting down at the ledge, Sibier buried his head in his hands. He took several heavy breaths, as frustration welled up in him. Nothing was going right. 
Sibier remembered feeling this way often before. His mind soon drifted, his memories consuming him.  He remembered a similar anger then, feeling the bitter bite of the king’s guards punch. He was sitting outside his family’s small house, just after the king’s guards had beaten him. His jaw had been throbbing, blood dripping from his split lip as fury consumed him. His fists had been clenched so tightly his knuckles had turned white, his heart racing with the urge for revenge.
He had been on the verge of running to the ritual shrines—a place where people swore oaths [av]through binding rituals. The temptation had been overwhelming, the bitterness in his chest demanding action and resolve. But just as he had stood to leave, his mother’s hand had rested gently on his shoulder, giving him pause.
Sibier sniffed, painfully absorbed by the memory. He had cried freely in her arms then — he could almost feel the tears now. He remembered vividly her gentle embrace, and the smell of burnt bread in her thick hair. Even now, it made his stomach rumble. 
After a few moments, she had brought out the worn, tattered book of ancient scripts. Together, they read, her voice calm and soothing as they turned the delicate pages. The words had been simple yet powerful—teachings about kindness, about treating others as you would wish to be treated. About giving and forgiving, freely and without hesitation. Even, she had said with a knowing smile, forgiving the king’s guards. They were the sons of the stars as well, she had taught, and therefore your brothers.
Her hazel eyes had been so full of concern when she looked at him, so full of love and understanding. Sibier remembered that look, how it had softened his heart. She understood. She always did.
</Karia> “Sibier,” she had said gently, her voice carrying a weight of wisdom far beyond her years, </Karia> “the Heavens teach us that we must be good to everyone.”
Sibier had nodded, his anger dissolving under her care, the torrent of bitterness replaced by an overwhelming sense of peace. 
</Sibier> “Sibier,” she continued, </Sibier> “you know about the sense — that feeling deep inside you — that scriptures speak so much about. That sense to do good, that pull towards kindness, is the real you. You are not anything else. You are not the labels the guards degrade you with. You are not your body. You aren’t even your thoughts whether good or bad. Sibier, that sense is you — it is the soul that the stars have made your body for.”
He had hugged her tightly then, tears welling in his eyes as the weight of her words settled over him. She had spoken with such clarity, such conviction, and in that moment, he had believed her with all his heart. He had heard it so many times, it wasn’t hard to hear her speak the words again in her head. 
</Karia> “Sibier,” she whispered firmly yet tenderly, </Werrin> “never betray that sense. Never betray your soul. Never betray who you truly are.”
</Werrin> “I won’t mom,” he had vowed, his voice shaking with emotion.  The rage that had consumed him before seemed so distant then, so insignificant. He had sat there with his mother, wrapped in her warmth, in her peace. He had been happy. He had let it all go, letting the anger slip away as he listened to his sense, to his soul.
But that was a different time.  
The charred taste of ash brought Sibier back to reality. The smoke stung his eyes, and when he looked up, the night sky was alight with the fiery orange glow of the burning fields. It appeared like the very heavens had gone to war. It painted the backdrop for him, twisting the once happy memory to leave a sour residue in his mind. 
What would she say now if she saw him? Sibier questioned. Would she still believe in that sense, in that inner goodness? He had felt it then, back in her arms, but now… now he felt nothing.
Sibier was numb. 
Brushing ash from his pants, Sibier’s thoughts turned dark. He couldn’t help but wonder if the soot clinging to his clothes came from the burnt cornfields or from the man’s flesh. His stomach turned at the thought, but it wasn’t the disgust that gnawed at him—it was something more unsettling. The memory of his hands around the man’s neck... It had felt good. For that brief, terrible moment, killing had filled him with a sense of satisfaction, of power. And skies, it wasn’t like the fleeting justifications he’d given himself in the past, the small betrayals of his sense for some temporary pleasure. No. This time had been different. This time, it was as though something else had taken over.
It hadn’t been a justification. It hadn’t been the quiet voice that his mother called the sense. But something darker. Something that consumed, devoured, destroyed… feeling like a new sense awakened by his curse.
Sibier swallowed, a chill creeping through his skin. What’s happening to me? The question clawed at the edges of his mind, refusing to leave him in peace. Why do I feel this way?
Sibier dug his nails into his skin, drawing blood. His thoughts spiraled out of control, his mind filled with dark images he couldn’t push away. He could feel it inside him—the twisted desire to tear, to burn, to destroy. The urge crawled beneath his skin like an itch he couldn’t scratch, making him sick to his core. 
WHY ARE THE SKIES QUIET? he screamed inwardly, clenching his eyes shut. Grinding his teeth, he fought against the rising tide of madness, but it was no use. The darkness spread through him, seeping into every corner of his mind tempting him to kill again, to feel that rush of power. He could barely hold it back, squirming as he sat. 
Gasping for breath, Sibier forced himself to look heavenwards as smoke filled his lungs. Pleading for relief, Sibier only received a cloud of soot that stung his eyes. 
Are the heavens even real? he wondered bitterly. Are my parents really there?
Again, there was no answer. Only silence.
Doubt festered in his heart, growing like a weed. And in that moment, Sibier gave in. He yielded to the dark desire rising within him, allowing it to settle in his chest like a cold, unrelenting hunger. It no longer chilled him—it burned. His regret for killing the man vanished, replaced by a terrible longing. A thirst for more. Another victim. The hunger surged through his veins, a wave of destructive power that made him feel invincible.
His arm flared in an explosion of light, shocking Sibier. He recoiled, disgusted by the feeling inside of him pushing it into the far recesses of his soul. With tears of anguish welling in his arms, Sibier crawled onto his knees, begging for divine help. 
Above him, the cloud of ash parted, letting a ray of the dawn’s  light through. It struck Sibier’s face, and with it came a smothering feeling of peace. The same feeling he had years ago when his mother embraced him. 
Breathing in, Sibier’s shoulders slumped as the dark sense retreated within him. He felt battered and bruised, but skies, he was whole. Cautiously, he looked down at his cursed arm, feeling a strand of terror lingering in his heart. 
His mother had taught him he was his sense[aw][ax]. But this other sense… was that him too? 
Deep in thought, Sibier sat there as the sun began to rise, unable to go back to where Karia kept the Darkened Dawn. He thought about going to see Ilyian before he awoke, yet he didn’t move — scared that the feeling might come back with his brother in his arms. The idea sent a shiver down his soul. He never could imagine himself doing that… but he could have never imagined himself killing someone either. 
He sat there lost in thought. It didn’t take long for him to imagine his mother coming to sit by him again. He relaxed, watching as the sun rise above the horizon. Even with all the ash floating in the air, the light seem to penetrate somewhere. The rays of sun felt good on his skin. 
Sibier didn’t notice Karia’s footsteps behind him. She touched his shoulder, before coming and sitting beside him. Sibier faintly smiled at her, forgetting their earlier disagreement. She didn’t say anything for a moment and instead looked at him intently with her large green eyes — she almost looked like his mother in that moment. It felt odd, as she couldn’t have been more than five years older than him.
</Werrin> “You had an eventful day,” she noted. </one of the men> “I bet your overwhelmed.”
Sibier sighed, feeling oddly at peace, though battered. </one of the men> “Yeah,” he admitted. 
Karia smiled at him, looking out over the field. Ash still rose high into the air. </one voice> “I remember when I had first felt that way,” she started, as her eyes grew unfocused. </Sibier> “It was nearly four years ago. Back then, my family ran a rather successful toy store. My father was a skilled carver, and was often hired out by some of the wealthiest barons and dukes in the kingdom.”
Karia smirked. </Sibier> “Back then, I had everything I could have wanted for myself as I managed our store and delivered the toys. I noticed back then the kids who didn’t have any, and how they would look longingly at me as I passed on the street. Pretty soon, I started giving a few of the toys I was supposed to deliver to them, and would tell my father I had lost them. At first, he would shrug and make more.”
Sibier looked over to her, glad by Karia’s company. </Karia> “Why are you telling me this?”
Karia shrugged. </Karia> “Because I thought you should know. Anyways, like I am stubborn today, I was stubborn back then. One of the daughters of the dukes saw that I was doing this told her father, who in turn threatened my father to ‘get a reign on his devilish daughter.’” At this, Karia’s voice twinged with hurt. </Karia> “My father in turn demanded that I stop giving away toys. But I wouldn’t.”
Karia looked wistfully into the sky. </Karia> “The next time I gave away toys, the duke ordered me arrested. I remember the kingdom guard's pounding on our door, and my father answered. I can still see the grim expression that came across his face. Sibier,” she squeezed his hand, </Sibier> “he didn’t even have tears in his eyes when he handed me over.
“As my father dragged me over to them…” She paused, as emotion filled her voice. </Sibier> “I don’t know what came over me. I grabbed a bottle off of the table and smashed it into his head. He collapsed to the ground, and I pushed past the guards into the street. 
“Eventually they caught me.” Karia bowed her head down. </The Rebellion> “I waited in a cell for what must have been a week before the Baron and my father came down. His head was heavily bandaged, and I tried to tell him I was sorry.” She sniffed, looking Sibier in the eyes.
</The Rebellion> “He didn’t care. The Baron suggested I be taken to the Trials for my rebellion, and all my father said was ‘I agree’. He didn’t even fight for me.”
Sibier looked at Karia, seeing her deeply for the first time. She had endured the same fate he had. Her family had betrayed her. </Karia> “I’m sorry,” he whispered. </Karia> “I imagine you were devastated.”
Karia snorted. </I> “That’s for sure. Luckily for me though as the guards were taking me to the Trials, it had been when Trent first started to rescue those sent there. I will never forget how he burst from the shadows, and saved my life. I had nowhere to go, and so I decided I would help him.”
</Karia> “I’m sorry.” Sibier didn’t know what more to say — what more could he say? No words could make up for that injustice.
Karia took a deep breath, speaking more naturally. </Karia> “So I do know what it feels like to be a prisoner Sibier. Sometimes I fear I have my Dad’s ruthlessness, but the Darkened Dawn had answers we needed to know.”
Sibier nodded, thoughts turning over in his head. He looked over the field, watching as the sun continued to peek its head over the ocean. </Karia> “I forgive you.”
</I> “Thanks.” Then, Karia shifted, resting her hands in her lap. </Karia> “He told us some important things. Apparently the Darkened Dawn and King Icar are after the same thing: something the man called the resurrection. It had something to do with the mist from yesterday, and those Tri[ay]als.” 
Sibier perked, interested. </Sibier> “What is it?”
</Karia> “The man didn’t know exactly. He mentioned it was their key to overthrowing the king,” Karia answered.
Sibier furrowed his brow. The Darkened Dawn wanted the kingdom? What was stopping them already? 
Karia looked at Sibier trying to read his face. </Karia> “If we could figure out what this ‘resurrection’ means and discover before they do, it might give us an edge.”
And so we can finally overthrow the kingdom, Sibier added bitterly, knowing that’s what Karia was implying. </Karia> “That doesn’t affect what we're doing,” he countered. </Karia> “Did you find a way into their storehouses?”
Karia grinned. </Skies> “Of course I did. I already have a plan to raid it too.”

Rekindling the Sparks
Chapter Fifteen                
























Head hung low, Sib[az]ier smeared dirt over the tender bruise on his cheek, letting his fingers linger a moment longer than needed. Karia and Captain Werrin each gripped one of his shoulders, and he let his legs drag behind him with feigned unconsciousness. The weight of their Darkened Dawn cloaks pressed down on them, the shadows from their hoods concealing their faces, but not the tension that tightened their movements. Every rustle of fabric felt louder in the deafening silence of the mountain pass.
The dirt path beneath them wound deeper into the jagged terrain, where the star’s light barely filtered through the dense, overhanging trees. The Darkened Dawn storage unit loomed ahead—a fortress of stone carved into the mountainside. Darkened, foreboding, and unnervingly still, the building felt like it was watching them approach. Even the usual forest chitter—birds, insects—had vanished, leaving only the soft shuffle of boots and the quick, unsteady breaths Sibier couldn’t seem to control. 
Fear coiled around his ribs, tightening with each step. He tried to keep his breathing shallow, but the chill of the air bit at his throat, making it hard to swallow. His mind whirled, grasping at any distraction. Stay calm. Stay focused. But all he could think about was what would happen if this went wrong. If they were caught. He forced down the bitter taste of dread that climbed his throat. 
Werrin lifted his chin, eyes narrowed at the imposing building. </We> “I’ve waited a long time for this,” he murmured, his voice grim and low. Sibier only swallowed, the dryness of his mouth struggling from his words. He hadn’t felt this way before.
</I> “Do you think we’ll get caught?” Sibier whispered, though the words barely made it past his lips. His courage felt as thin as the air around them, stretched to the breaking point.
Karia glanced down at him, her expression unreadable in the shadow of her hood. Was it calculation behind her eyes? Or maybe a fleeting trace of sympathy? Sibier couldn’t tell. Her fingers tightened slightly around his arm, offering no comfort, only anchoring him to the present.
</I> “We might,” Werrin muttered flatly to Sibier’s question, not even sparing him a glance. There was no false reassurance, no lie to ease the growing pit in his stomach.
Sibier cast a quick look around, desperately searching for any sign of comfort. The flickering outlines of Werrin’s troops caught his eye—shadowy forms flitting against the far wall of the storehouse, keeping to the shadows. They were there, hidden, gray and ghostlike, searching for the backdoor — the location Karia had pried from their prisoner. To Sibier, that interaction had felt like torture. Remembering the deception they used — even if it was necessary for this attack for the greater good — left a bitter taste in Sibier’s mouth.Skies, it shouldn’t have come to that. Even knowing they had no other choice didn’t ease the hollow feeling inside him. His gut twisted at it, as a dark feeling crept across his spine. Not now…
A figure stood in the entrance, the cowl of his cloak pulled low over his face, arms folded across his chest. The Darkened Dawn member’s gaze flicked between the three of them, his stance stiff with suspicion. His chin lifted, a single sharp motion, like a blade being drawn from its sheath. </I> “What are you doing with him?” 
Werrin yanked Sibier’s arm roughly, pulling him forward. Sibier stumbled, eyes squeezed shut, forcing himself to go limp, to sell the act. His pulse hammered in his throat, every beat a reminder of how close they were to disaster. The world around him became a blur of muffled sounds—Karia’s shallow breaths, Werrin’s heavy, deliberate exhale. His own heartbeat was loudest of all, the rhythm erratic and frantic. 
</I> “We got him,” Werrin replied, voice clipped. 
The silence that followed felt like it stretched forever, like the very air was holding its breath, waiting for something to break. Sibier’s heart raced, and he felt Karia’s fingernails dig into his arm—an involuntary reaction, or perhaps a warning. Either way, it made his skin crawl.
</I> “Show me,” the Darkened Dawn member demanded, his tone laced with disbelief, like he was already anticipating a trick.
Sibier braced himself. He felt Werrin’s rough hands grab his sleeve, yanking it up to expose the cursed arm beneath. The cool night air hit his skin, and for a moment, he wondered if the man could see the slight tremor running through his muscles.
Another long pause.
Sibier didn’t dare open his eyes. The tension was unbearable, but he didn’t move. Then, Werrin roughly pulled the sleeve back down. The movement was swift and sharp, and Sibier’s breath hitched, half-expecting a strike to come next. The silence stretched on for another excruciating moment.
</I> “Come inside,” the Darkened Dawn member said at last, the disbelief now replaced with something colder, more calculated. </I> “But why did you come here… instead of going directly to the Master?”
The question, heavy and sharp, cut into Sibier’s already fraying nerves. Karia’s grip on his arm tensed again, her nails biting into his skin. He barely felt it—his focus was on the Darkened Dawn guard, his mind whirling with unease. Skies above, he thought counter to his belief before, heart pounding. If only we had pressed that prisoner harder, learned more—learned who this </You> “Master” was… 
But now it was too late for regrets.
Werrin scoffed in reply, the sound thick with disdain. Sibier felt his feet begin to drag as they moved inside, a shudder of cold running up from the stones below. </You> “You expect us to risk the security of our tribute,” Werrin sneered as they walked, </Sibier> “by traveling all that way at night? You’re a fool.”
Why did Werrin say that? Sibier’s gut twisted, his stomach lurching into his throat. Panic clawed its way from his stomach to his mind, threatening to take control, but something else resonated deeper—a silent, fierce courage that had no room to breathe. Stay calm, it whispered. Don't fall apart now. 
The Darkened Dawn’s response was quick. </You> “I meant to send word to the Master. Not travel there.”
Werrin’s reply came fast, cutting. </I> “Are you always this shortsighted? What if it was intercepted?”
</I> “I—”
</Werrin> “Don’t,” Werrin cut him off, stepping forward, his tone commanding authority now. </Werrin> “Get the others manning this storehouse. I want everyone prepared to help us escort the Tribute to the Master. No excuses. No delays.”
There was a pause, thick with tension. Sibier barely dared to breathe. For a second, he thought the man would question them further, but instead, he heard a shuffle of boots retreating, the Darkened Dawn hurrying off.
Sibier’s relief was short-lived as both Karia and Werrin unceremoniously dropped him. He landed hard on his knees, a sharp grunt escaping his lips as pain shot up his legs. </Werrin> “Sibier,” Karia hissed through clenched teeth, </Werrin> “open your eyes.”
Still dizzy from the fall, Sibier blinked, his vision adjusting to the dim glow around him. The soft hues of glowstone lined the floor in blue and yellow, casting unsettling shadows that danced up the cold stone walls. It was eerie, how even the light here seemed to hum with danger. The warmth of the stones beneath his palms caught him off guard, their faint energy pulsing under his fingertips.
Before Sibier could fully gather himself, Karia had already shrugged off her Darkened Dawn cloak. She tossed it to him, her movements brisk but efficient. They didn’t know how much time they had. 
Catching the cloak, Sibier met Karia’s steeled gaze. Her eyes burned with that same fierce determination, but there was something else there too—something he couldn’t quite name. It wasn’t fear exactly, but it wasn’t confidence either. Her expression was uncannily steeled, almost hauntingly so. What does Karia feel in moments like these? he wondered. She never showed hesitation, never wavered in her resolve. But the movements almost felt mechanical, devoid of thought at times, as if she was broken. 
As he threw the cloak over himself, Sibier swallowed hard, pushing his own doubts down. He wasn’t sure how much longer he could keep up this façade of strength. The shadows of the chamber seemed to press in on him, the uncertainty of their mission, the weight of the means they’d used to get here—the torture, the lies—bearing down on him more than ever. What have I gotten myself into? Is this really what the stars want me to do?[ba] The questions gnawed at him, but he shook it off. They needed to focus.
A screeching sound pierced the quiet, and Sibier whirled around, his heart lurching. Werrin had slid aside a large bookcase, the stone floor grinding underneath its weight. He gestured towards the narrow space behind it, and grunted. </Werrin> “This’ll do.” 
Heavens above! Couldn’t he have done that any quieter? 
Sibier looked at the makeshift hiding spot, then back at Werrin. The captain’s face was solemn, set in that same rigid determination that had brought them this far. Yet Sibier couldn’t help but notice the lines of strain around his eyes—eyes that rarely blinked, as if always planning to curb the constant threats to his family’s well being in any way possible. Werrin was a man of discipline, and in moments like this, Sibier wondered if Werrin ever questioned the morality of his actions. For Werrin, everything had a purpose and anything could be a means to an end if it meant securing a future for his daughters. But for Sibier… [bb][bc][bd]did any good reason justify the pain he would bring others?[be]
As Sibier settled into the hiding spot, the silence pressed down again, heavier this time. Sibier’s mind raced. They were about to risk everything—risk more lives, possibly innocent lives. And they were using information ripped from a man’s pain to do it. Karia might have steeled herself, and Werrin might seem unfazed, but he... he couldn’t ignore the wrongness curling in his gut.
The Darkened Dawn wasn’t just an enemy. These people had names, families, lives. Just like his. The thought echoed in his head, an uncomfortable reminder of what they were really here to do. The stars were silent, as they often were, and that silence — that void of guidance — left him wondering what kind of man he was becoming. How far would I go to get what I want? How far would I go to give Ilyian the world I wished I had?
Sibier bit his lip, reminding himself of the reality of the situation. The Darkened Dawn are hoarding food. They have the equipment you need to build your dream. His hands twitched, picking at the skin on his forearm as the thought nagged at him. The stars guided you here. But had they?
He glanced sideways at Karia and Werrin, both of whom were now preparing to sound the alarm. Karia’s face was set, determined. Werrin, meanwhile, was moving with a focused determination that unsettled Sibier—too mechanical for someone whose motives Sibier wasn’t sure he trusted anymore[bf]. No one has to die, Sibier reminded himself, clenching his fists. But the itch, that horrible, gnawing itch in his fingers—Not now…
Werrin strode over to Karia, his boots making barely a sound on the stone. </Werrin> “I think we’ve given them enough time,” he whispered. There was no malice in his voice, only a measured calmness that Sibier had come to associate with the captain’s calculated thinking. It wasn’t cruelty—it was necessity. Werrin didn’t enjoy this. He was doing what he thought had to be done. Sibier, however, rarely agreed. [bg]
Karia glanced out the door and towards the mountains, her expression unreadable. </Sibier> “I’m ready,” she murmured. Her voice, though steady, carried an edge of tension.
Sibier didn’t say anything. His mind felt tangled, heavy with unease. He wanted to believe this was the right course, that everything Werrin and Karia were doing was justified—but was it? His fingers dug into his forearm, scratching lightly at the skin as his thoughts spiraled. Deep in his gut, he almost knew someone was going to die… and he felt as though he would be the one responsible.
Werrin’s gaze flicked toward him, a brief glance that seemed almost... reassuring? He gave Sibier a firm nod before turning back to Karia. </Sibier> “Alright, start running,” he said quietly, his voice lowering even more.
The next moment, Werrin’s voice erupted in a practiced panic. </Werrin> “HELP!” he bellowed, his voice echoing off the stone walls. </Werrin> “The Rebellion’s come here for the—” He slammed a book into the wall, cutting himself off with a crashing thud. The noise reverberated throughout the storehouse, a sharp crack that seemed to vibrate in Sibier’s bones. 
Without missing a beat, Werrin darted behind the bookcase, pulling Sibier with him. They crouched together, hidden in the tight space, the air thick with the smell of dust and musty pages. Werrin’s breath was slow and measured, calm in the face of the chaos they were about to unleash. Sibier, on the other hand, was struggling to keep his own breathing steady, the fear clawing its way up his throat.
Pleading to the stars, He listened to the distant sound of Karia’s footsteps fading into the night. The silence that followed was unbearable, pressing down on him like a weight. For a brief moment, it felt like time had stopped, and Sibier’s mind raced with a thousand thoughts. Heaven above, help her. Skies, help me too!
Then, all at once, the silence shattered.
The door to the inner chamber burst open with a loud crack, and the storehouse exploded into a chorus of frantic voices. </Werrin> “Did you hear that?” one of the men shouted. </Werrin> “Where’d they go?”
        Sibier held his breath, his body tensing as Darkened Dawn members stormed through the entrance, their footsteps heavy and urgent. The sounds of chaos filled the air—the thudding of boots, the clatter of weapons, the frantic shouting. </Werrin> “Heavens above, they’re escaping around the bend!” one voice cried out.
Sibier forced himself to stay still, pressing tighter against the wall as one of the Darkened Dawn passed within inches of their hiding place, smelling the mint on his breath. Werrin was beside him, unflinching, his eyes unfocused — just like the night he stood in front of the burning field as the flames glistened in his eyes. 
Sibier shivered. He’s not evil, he reminded himself, as if repeating it would make it easier to believe. He’s doing this for his daughters. He’s doing this because he has to…
But that didn’t make the knot of dread in Sibier’s chest any smaller.
One by one, the Darkened Dawn members rushed past, their cloaks whipping behind them. Five... six... eight... twelve...
None had dared turn their head in his direction yet, but it would only take a moment for everything to unravel. But Werrin had been confident in Karia’s plan—insisting the Darkened Dawn weren’t trained soldiers, that they wouldn’t be thorough. They would panic, scatter, make mistakes. He’d been so sure of it. But Sibier had learned not to trust certainty… and after the fire, he learned not to trust anyone either. 
But tonight, heavens above, he hoped Werrin was right. 
As the last set of footsteps echoed away, the noise outside died down into a tense, eerie silence. Sibier’s heart pounded in his ears, his hands still shaking slightly from the adrenaline. He swallowed hard, willing himself to stay calm. They waited another moment, and then Werrin’s hand landed firmly on Sibier’s shoulder, his grip steady and strong. </He> “Let’s go,” he whispered. </You> “Before they come back.”
Sibier nodded. There was no turning back now.

*[bh] Section Break *

        Trent brushed aside the thick foliage as his men trudged through the mountains. The sound of their boots crunching over rocks and dry earth was rhythmic, familiar—yet unsettling. It reminded him too much of his days with the rebellion, leading silent troops through the wilderness. Back then, there had been hope in the silence. Now, only dread hung in the air, thick and suffocating. His men felt it—he could see it in their faces. They marched in uneasy quiet, their eyes flicking warily toward the jagged cliffs and the dark shadows of the forest. Many of them believed they were marching to their deaths.
Trent kept his gaze forward, his heart heavy with an emotion he couldn't quite name. He knew why they were here—why this attack had to happen. The kingdom was starving. The storehouses were empty. King Icar had grown desperate, and that desperation had bled into his people. But it wasn’t just desperation that drove Trent. No, for him, this attack was something that resonated deep within him. It was something more. 
This raid... it was his chance. His chance to feel like himself again.
The rebellion leader. 
The hero he once imagined himself to be.
His High Executioner cloak, however, clung to him like a shadow—a reminder of what he had become, and of the blood on his hands. Trent set his jaw, and continued marching forward, and hit his side. I can forget all of that for today, he told himself, though he knew it wasn’t true. The memory of the man he had just killed in the Trials—the fear in his eyes—still gnawed at him. Even now, Trent could see that man's face, lifeless and hollow, etched forever in his mind. I did it for my family..., he reminded himself again, but the words felt thin, almost hollow. Was this what being a hero had come to? Killing for survival, not freedom?
His fingers drifted to the wound on his side, the one Karia had given him the night he betrayed her and the rebellion. His uniform was still torn there, the fabric frayed around the edges. He had kept the uniform—he wasn’t sure why. Maybe it was a reminder, a grim trophy, or maybe it was a mark of shame he couldn’t let go of. Either way, the scar beneath would never fully heal. He wouldn’t let it. 
Those lifeless eyes never left his mind.
Trent pushed aside dangling foliage, keeping his gaze straight ahead, fixated as though he had seen a ghost. He kept moving, but his mind felt frozen. Would his children hate me forever? Trent wiped sweat from his brow, but the moisture on his face wasn’t just from the heat. Tears had welled up in his eyes. 
Will they hate me forever, like I hate the kingdom for murdering my brother? The thought was a knife twisting in his chest, and he pressed harder on his wound, as though the pain there could somehow smother the anguish in his heart.
A gust of wind rustled his cloak, and his eyes fell to the torn fabric again. Skies, how many times had he thought about Karia? She would have loved this, he thought bitterly. </Sibier> “Tonight is a perfect night for this raid,” he could almost hear her saying, her voice light and teasing. </Sibier> “The full moon, the stars—like they’re lighting the way for us.” In his mind, she would turn to him with that mischievous smirk of hers, her cheeks crinkling, and her eyes sparkling. </Werrin> “But it’s perfect because I’m with you.” 
The tears spilled freely now. Trent sniffled, trying to swallow the lump in his throat. Scanning the glade around him, he saw one of the wildflowers Karia loved—the dark purple petals with their electric blue bulbs. If Karia were here, he’d pluck one, just like he used to. He could picture it so clearly: her smiling as he tucked the flower behind her ear, leaning in close to whisper, </He> “The flower is my promise. We’ll go together, and we’ll come back together.” She would smile at that—Skies, she always smiled.
But Karia wasn’t here. 
Trent bent down and picked the flower anyway, holding it gently in his hand as if it might break. His men had caught up by now, their breaths ragged from the climb, but he didn’t turn to face them. He kept his back to them, the wildflower cradled in his palm, staring at it like it held the answers to all his doubts.
I can fix this. I can fix everything—for Karia, for my family, for the people. He squeezed the flower gently, feeling the fragile stem bend under his fingers. I have to fix it.
His men shuffled behind him, shifting uneasily. They were waiting for him, for their orders, for their leader to take the next step. But Trent stood rooted to the spot, his eyes slipping shut as he breathed deeply. The forest around him whispered in the wind—the soft sway of the trees, the distant chittering of insects burrowing in the bark, the rustling leaves all blending into a gentle symphony that unraveled the knot of his tension. For a fleeting moment, he let himself feel the sense[bi]: the calm, the stillness of nature and the sway of the stars. His heart beat slowly in his chest, the pulse of life steady beneath his skin.
You’ve done terrible things, Trent, he thought, the weight of his choices sinking deep. But what matters most is what you do now. You are only defeated once you surrender your hope.
He swallowed hard, his throat tight. His hand brushed over the rough fabric of the High Executioner’s cloak, its coarse texture coarse against his skin, stained with blood and guilt. Slowly but deliberately, he shrugged it off. The heavy garment slipped from his shoulders, crumpling to the ground like a shed skin. It was as if the woods themselves breathed new life into him, the chill of the mountain air seeping into his bones, cleansing him of the title that had defined his sin. You’ve been the High Executioner long enough, he told himself. It’s time to leave that behind.
The wildflower remained in his hand, fragile and bright. He rubbed its petals between his fingers, picturing Karia’s smile when he would have tucked it behind her ear. We’ll still come back together, he imagined whispering to her, the words filled with hope. He squeezed his eyes shut, feeling his soul expand in an orchestra of emotions, too complex to fully grasp. For the first time in too long, Trent turned his gaze to the stars above, a sense of longing and understanding filling him. What is it that you want to tell me? 
Then, as if an answer, a sound snapped him from the reverie—faint at first, but unmistakable. His ears perked, and his eyes narrowed toward the trees. His hand instinctively reached for the hilt of his sword.
He heard it again. It was faint, but was unmistakable — a distant clatter of metal. His body went rigid, listening, straining for any further clues. The sound came again. And again. Faster and faster. 
Trent’s heart began to race, pounding against his ribs. Then, he heard it—the scream. It cut through the air like a knife, freezing his blood. The scream was desperate, raw. It was a voice he knew all too well.
Karia.
The wildflower nearly slipped from his fingers, but Trent caught it at the last second. Quickly, he tucked it into his pocket, his mind snapping into action. He spun on his heels, his gaze locking onto his men. Their expressions were tense, eyes wide as they searched for his command.
</Sibier> "After me, men!" Trent shouted, his voice sharper now, urgent. Without another word, he broke into a sprint, his boots pounding against the dirt as he darted toward the sound. The calm of the forest shattered as he ran, the peace of the moment evaporating into thin air.
Karia.

Chapter Sixteen
</Icar> “And the stars shall be stricken with grief, and shall be tram[bj]pled under the feet of men, treated as things of naught. Darkness will be a blanket over their minds.”
























Trent crested the mountain’s ridge, scrambling over loose rocks as the cool air filled his lungs. For the first time in a long time, he felt alive, a powerful clarity sweeping through him as he raced towards the sounds echoing from below. The distant shouts had faded now, but he was certain he’d heard Karia’s voice. 
He didn’t dare slow his pace as he neared the edge, peering over the crest. And then he saw her.
Karia stood in the valley below, her hands bound tightly behind her back, a dark bruise spreading across her right cheek. A thin line of blood traced her jaw where the knife at her throat pressed too close. Around her, two Darkened Dawn soldiers lay unmoving on the ground, their bodies sprawled in a testament to her resistance. Another one slumped against a rock with a sword still embedded in his gut.
Despite the grim situation, Trent felt a smirk tug at his lips. Seven-to-one odds, and she’d already taken down three of them. Skies, he loved how she fought like wildfire, missing that fierce, untamable spirit at his side.
The Darkened Dawn soldiers still standing were saying something to her, but Trent didn’t care to listen. All he could see was the blade to her throat and the wary, defiant tilt of her chin. She didn’t look defeated; even with her hands tied, she stood tall, her eyes sharp, her shoulders tense but steady. She had the same fire in her eyes that night Trent had first found her—the night the Kingdom guards had captured her to take her to the Trials. 
He had saved her then. 
And by the stars above, he would save her now.
Without a second thought, Trent slipped over the crest and crept down the slope, his footsteps quiet. He reached for his dagger, the same one he’d taught her to throw years ago, back when she’d colored his life with banter and laughter, insisting she could match him in skill. And skies, she’d surpassed him soon enough. He could almost hear her teasing him, daring him to keep up.
Now, with his heart pounding and memories of their training days tugging at his mind, he took aim. The cultist stood still, unaware, and Trent knew he wouldn’t miss. With a quick flick of his wrist, the dagger sliced through the air, embedding itself in the man’s skull. He dropped instantly, freeing Karia.
Trent didn’t wait for his men to follow. Bursting from the cover of trees, he roared as he drew his sword, scrambling the remaining Darkened Dawn.
The nearest cultist spun around, shock splashed across her face. Her mouth widened, a scream curdling in her throat. The rebellion. They’re here!” 
</Icar> “Blasted right we are,” Trent muttered as he swung. The victim didn’t even have time to draw her weapon. Not far behind Trent, his men surged out from the forest, their voices echoing his cry as they swept into the valley like a tidal wave.
Karia had already seized a fallen weapon, her stance shifting into a familiar readiness. The last two cultists glanced at each other, outnumbered twenty-to-two, and dropped their weapons without a fight. 
Trent wiped the sweat from his brow, breathing heavily. He turned to his men, nodding toward the prisoners. </Sibier> “Tie them up,” he ordered, his voice sharp, but his gaze was already drifting back to Karia. He sheathed his sword, but his heart was still pounding for a different reason. He remembered those condemning words she spoke to him in the priso[bk]n: Am I not family to you? I had trusted you… I’m not sure I should anymore. Go Away! Leave me alone. 
Trent didn’t know seeing her again would rip at his heart. </Karia> “Karia,” he breathed, his voice almost breaking. </Karia> “I’m… I’m so glad to see you.”
Karia’s eyes flickered, her expression a storm of conflicting emotions. She touched her head, wincing slightly as her fingers came away sticky with blood. Her gaze hardened. </ARREST THAT BOY> “How’d you find me?” she demanded, the edge in her tone unmistakable. </ARREST THAT BOY> “What are you doing here?”
Trent raised his eyebrows, taken aback by her brazen bitterness. </ARREST THAT BOY> “No ‘thank you’ for saving your life? Skies, Karia!”
Karia grimaced. </I> “You owed me. How’d you even know where I was?”
Trent’s fingers hesitated on the fragile flower, as it weighed heavily against him. He saw something detached in Karia’s eyes, a hurt that was a fissure into her soul. It felt… it felt so familiar. It was that same look she had when she told him about her father’s betrayal. 
But it also felt so different. Now that gaze, that pain, was directed towards him. Accusing him. Furious at him. Trent dropped the petal back into his pocket, folding his arms. 
</I> “I didn’t. Karia…”
Karia interrupted him, spitting her very words like ice. </Werrin> “Then why are you here Trent?” She stepped forwards, her bloody finger pointing at him. </Werrin> “Why aren’t you spending time with Icar! Didn’t you betray me for that blasted tyrant!”
Trent’s heart stopped, his blood freezing in his veins. The air was thick with tension as those words hung heavy, the silence stretching between them. Slowly, his hands inched once again to the flower in his pocket, and tenderly lifted it out. Its petals were crushed and the stem bent, but Trent held it out to her as if it were a jewel. </The High Execution> “Karia…” he began, his voice quieter, softer. </Sibier> “Can you forgive me?” He didn’t know what else to say. 
Karia’s gaze dropped to the flower, her eyes lingering on it before lifting to meet his. There was a flicker of something—pain, maybe even longing—but it was buried beneath layers of guarded distance. She still held her finger to his nose.
Trent swallowed, words tumbling out before he could stop them. </Sibier> “Look, I know I messed up. These last few weeks, it feels like I’ve been trapped with no way out. I thought I was doing the right thing, that I could protect everyone, but—” He broke off, struggling to hold her gaze. </Sibier> “You’re my family too, Karia. And I couldn’t have failed you more.”
Karia’s face softened, but her lips remained pressed into a tight line. The vulnerability in her eyes was fleeting, replaced by a wary bitterness. She lowered her arm.
Trent took a shaky breath, gathering his courage, and placed the flower in her hands, wrapping his fingers around hers. </Sibier> “Skies, I want us back. I want to be who I was with you. I’m not the High Executioner. I don’t want to be. I want to be with you. Can I be… can we be?”
For a moment, Karia’s expression cracked. Her lips trembled, the way they always did when she was holding back tears, and Trent’s heart ached to pull her into an embrace. When she spoke, her voice was barely a whisper, fragile and uncertain. </Sibier> “How can we, Trent? After everything? We’ve lost it all.”
He looked over his shoulder at his men, who stood awkwardly, their expressions a mix of unease and impatience. Trent could feel their discomfort, their silent judgment of Karia, the lingering distrust they held toward her. Despite wanting to keep this moment private, he knew he couldn’t: these men didn’t trust him, but he owed her honesty now, even if it was in front of his—no, the kings’—men.
</Sibier> “I don’t have all the answers,” he admitted, his voice steady but full of raw truth. </Sibier> “I have to work with Icar, yes. But now he’s only having me go after the Darkened Dawn. This? This is something I would have done. Maybe… maybe it’s a path back.” He tried to smile, though it barely reached his eyes. </He> “Maybe there is still hope.”
Karia let out a short, bitter laugh, her eyes glinting with skepticism. She stepped back, pulling her hand away from Trent. </Sibier> “Hope?” she repeated, her voice laced with something between sarcasm and genuine sorrow. </Sibier> “After everything that’s happened?” 
He held her gaze, unflinching. </Sibier> “You’re only defeated once you surrender that hope, Karia. I might have been the one to say it, but you were the one who taught me it.” He rubbed his thumb against his palm, feeling the rough calluses but also the scars. </Sibier> “Do you think you can forgive me? Do you think we can find a way forward?”
Karia stared at him, her gaze intense and searching. The silence stretched between them, her expression wavering as she looked down at the crushed flower in her hands. For a long, breathless moment, she said nothing, and Trent’s heart pounded with a mixture of fear and anticipation.
Finally, she spoke, her voice a mere whisper. </Men> “Yes[bl],” she said, the word hanging in the air like something precious and fragile. But then, her eyes widened in sudden realization, a jolt of urgency snapping her out of the moment. </Sibier> “Blast it, Trent!” She cursed, her tone shifting instantly. </that boy> “We need to get back to the storehouse—now!”
Trent blinked, bewildered by the abrupt change. </We> “What?”
Without another word, Karia grabbed him by the wrist, her grip firm and unyielding, yanking him forward. </I> “I’ll explain on the way.”

*[bm] Section Break *

 With trembling fingers, Sibier unlocked the hinges, easing the door open. The faint creak echoed through the stillness like a warning. He paused, straining to hear any sound beyond the soft dripping of water from the ceiling. The silence felt alive, pressing against his ears. Even the faint scuffle of ants in the dirt beside him sounded unnervingly loud.
This close to the mountain, the Darkened Dawn had used the natural stone to fortify their structure. The room before them was more of a cavern than anything, sprawling deep into the mountain’s heart, its ceiling disappearing into shadow, its floor vanishing into darkness. A faint draft ghosted through, carrying with it a chill that raised goosebumps on his arms.
Glowstone dotted the walls, scattered and faint because of the cold, their dim light only barely holding the darkness at bay. The pale, spectral glow gave the cavern an otherworldly feel—like walking through a forgotten night sky. For a moment, Sibier felt insignificant, as if the cavern itself was staring back at him. He swallowed hard, his breath coming short.
Werrin stepped into the cavern behind Sibier, his expression grim and determined. </I> “We found it.”
Sibier nodded slowly, his throat dry. His eyes fell on the mountain of sacks piled in front of him—hundreds of bags of dried corn and grain. For so long, he had dreamed of this moment, so much so that it didn’t feel real. Heavens above, would they even need the equipment they had come for?  
Sibier let his eyes drift over the spectacle. Skies, he thought, his stomach tightening. This is enough to feed entire villages. Enough to fill empty tables, quiet crying children. Iyian was at the forefront of his mind.
But the awe twisted into something uglier as the weight of the truth settled in. This much food… hoarded. Kept here while the rest of the kingdom starved. It made his stomach churn. The selfishness of it clawed at his insides. How many had died while the Darkened Dawn sat here, their stockpiles untouched?
His hands jittered as he stepped forward, drawn toward the nearest bag. The rough burlap scraped under his trembling fingers, and he felt the kernels shift beneath the surface. His stomach gave an involuntary growl. It’s real.
</I> “Sibier.” Werrin’s voice cut through his thoughts, sharp and precise. </I> “The key.”
Sibier blinked, startled out of his daze. He rose quickly, almost fumbling as he crossed to the metal door on the far side of the cavern. Werrin scraped aside loose dirt, revealing its rust from years of unuse. It had been sheer luck—and Karia’s interrogation—that had given the secret away. As Sibier fumbled with the key, he could hear Werrin’s men plodding outside, their footfalls sending faint vibrations through the door. 
Jostling the key in his hand, Sibier shoved it into the lock. The metal clicked softly as the mechanism turned, and Werrin wasted no time yanking the door open. Dirt poured through the opening, scattering across the floor as the soldiers outside stumbled in, their faces streaked with sweat and grime.
As the scent of sweat wafted by, Sibier felt a wave of disbelief wash over him. It’s working. We’re actually doing this. He almost let himself smile, almost let the relief take hold. 
As Werrin’s soldiers filled the room, the captain didn’t waste a moment orchestrating his men. Soon they were organizing themselves, and grabbing bags. Werrin’s command to Sibier came only a moment later. </Captain> “Sibier, get out of the way and let my men work.”
The words hit Sibier like a slap, stripping away the fragile pride he had begun to feel. He stepped aside, his cheeks flushing with embarrassment. </I> “Go lock the entrance,” Werrin continued. </I> “Make sure no one from the Darkened Dawn comes this way.”
 </I> “Right,” Sibier muttered, biting the inside of his cheek. He turned on his heel, heading back toward the entrance. As he moved, his footsteps felt heavier, his chest tightening with each step.
Skies, I’m just another one of his soldiers, Sibier thought bitterly as he locked the door with a soft click. The metal was cold beneath his fingers, grounding him even as his mind spiraled. He leaned his forehead against it, his breath leaving him in a shaky exhale.
How can I think I’m any better than Werrin? The thought filled him with lead. Werrin had joined the Kingdom’s forces for his family—wasn’t that why Sibier had clawed his way to survival, even to the point when he tried to join the Kingdom himself? But still… Werrin had betrayed him at that moment. And then again in the field. That bitter taste in his mouth wouldn’t leave. He had burned food that could’ve fed thousands.
He turned, his back to the door, watching Werrin in the cavern beyond. Werrin’s men moved like a well-oiled machine, hoisting sacks of grain and corn in steady rhythm. And there was Werrin himself—grunting under the weight of a bag, hauling it alongside his soldiers. Sibier’s face remained flat, but something deep in his chest shifted. He couldn’t deny it—Werrin wasn’t a man who commanded from the rear. He was here, doing the same work as his men. Down-to-earth. Focused, humble and honorable.
Despite himself, Sibier felt a flicker of admiration. Whatever he thought of Werrin’s methods, the man was effective. He cared. Sibier rubbed the back of his neck, uncomfortable with the thought. How could he be both?
The faint sound of jostling metal snapped him back to reality. Sibier stiffened, his ears straining. Footsteps. A key scratching in the lock. His pulse quickened.
</Sibier> “They’re coming!” Sibier hissed, his voice sharp with urgency.
The door shuddered as someone outside tried to push it open. Reacting instinctively, Sibier threw himself against it, slamming it shut with all his weight. Muffled curses filtered through from the other side as the door rattled violently beneath his palms.
Werrin was at his side in an instant, dragging a sack of grain with him. </I> “Use this!” he barked, his voice cutting through the noise.
Sibier turned to grab it, but in that split-second, the door burst open, slamming Sibier to the ground. The impact sent a jolt of pain through his back as dirt and debris rained down around him. Two Darkened Dawn pushed through the opening, their blades flashing in the glowstone’s faint light.
</I> “Blast it!” Werrin cursed, drawing his sword as the cultists advanced.
Scrambling to his feet, Sibier’s hand darted to the knife at his belt, but his grip faltered. His heart hammered in his chest as the sound of a horn bellowed through the chamber. The warning had been sounded.
Werrin met the two attackers head-on, but he was outnumbered. Steel clashed against steel as he blocked their strikes, his footing unsteady on the uneven ground. He was losing ground fast, his movements slower than the precision of his enemies.
</I> “Sibier!” Werrin’s voice was sharp with desperation, cutting through the chaos.
But Sibier’s legs felt rooted to the ground. His chest tightened, his cursed arm beginning to itch. The knife in his hand felt impossibly heavy. His thoughts drifted, unbidden, to the fire—the smoke, the food reduced to ash, the hollow eyes of the man he had killed. I killed him. I killed him.
Werrin stumbled, his boot catching on a fallen bag of grain. One of the Darkened Dawn slashed at him, and though Werrin parried the blade, another sliced across his leg. A deep red gash opened on his thigh, and the captain staggered, barely deflecting the next strike.
</You> “Sibier!” Werrin shouted again, his voice cracking with effort as he dodged another blow. The Darkened Dawn pressed forward, relentless.
But Sibier remained frozen. His breaths came shallow, his cursed arm burning beneath his skin as guilt and doubt warred within him. He watched as Werrin raised his sword to block yet another strike, only to be sent sprawling by a swift kick to his chest. His blade skittered across the ground, coming to rest far out of reach.
Move, Sibier told himself. His fingers twitched, but they refused to obey, the weight of his past pressing down on him like a physical force. His legs were stiff. His arms solid rock. 
Sibier didn’t move[bn] an inch. 
The sword came down—
A knife flew through the air, burying itself in the shoulder of the nearest cultist. The strike sent the blade’s arc wide, the sharp edge crashing harmlessly into the stone inches from Werrin’s head.
The second cultist hesitated just long enough for Werrin to scramble backward, blood dripping from his leg. Two of his soldiers arrived at that moment, swords drawn, intercepting the attackers before they could press their advantage. The sharp clash of steel echoed off the cavern walls, punctuated by labored breathing and strained grunts. The soldier’s pushed the cultists back, leaving Werrin in safety. 
        Sibier’s chest heaved, his pulse hammering against his ribs. He stood frozen, knife still clutched in his hand, watching as Werrin’s soldiers struggled against the cultists.
Werrin looked up at Sibier, his gaze sharp and cutting despite the pain etched into his features. </You> “What… what in the depths were you doing, Sibier?” he rasped, his tone teetering between anger and disbelief.
Sibier’s grip on his knife tightened, his cursed arm pulsing faintly. He opened his mouth to respond, but no words came out. His chest burned with shame, his heart pounding in his ears. He felt stunned, the growing rumble of footsteps echoing from the tunnel a mere background noise… until more Darkened Dawn poured through the opening. 
The first of the reinforcements lunged straight for Sibier.
The sudden movement snapped Sibier out of his daze. He jerked to the side, narrowly avoiding the strike, and stumbled backward. His grip on his blade tightened, the weapon’s weight no longer foreign but somehow heavier. His breathing was ragged, his limbs sluggish. Skies, he thought, his mind reeling. What happened? Why didn’t I help Werrin?
        But his enemy gave him no time to think. The cultist jabbed again, forcing Sibier back toward the corner of the room. He stumbled over a sack of grain, nearly losing his footing. 
As the Darkened Dawn approached, the cavern erupted into chaos as the remaining Darkened Dawn clashed with Werrin’s men, who had formed a loose defensive line near the exit. Sibier’s heart sank. Where had these all come from? 
Sibier didn’t get another chance to think. The Darkened Dawn pressed the attack, wildly swinging. Sibier scrambled to put distance between them, grabbing a nearby bag of grain and shoving it between them. He noticed the knife still embedded in the man’s arm, blood trickling down his sleeve. The cultist grimaced but sneered through his pain, spitting onto the ground.
</You> “How’d you get that cloak?” the man growled, his voice filled with contempt.
        Sibier didn’t respond. His breathing came heavy and uneven, his legs trembling. His eyes darted toward Werrin, who barked orders to his men as they held the advancing Darkened Dawn at bay. The captain’s movements were slower now, his injured leg hindering him. Sibier felt a pang of guilt twist in his gut.
The cultist snarled and lunged again, and Sibier barely scrambled out of the way, ducking behind another sack of grain. He finally pulled his sword out of its scabbard and he raised it defensively, but his footing was uncertain, his thoughts clouded.
        Out of the corner of his eye, something flickered. Sibier’s breath hitched as phantom-like figures emerged from the swirling mist behind Werrin’s defensive line, their dark eyes burning with fury. Their forms were twisted and ephemeral, and Sibier felt their hollow gazes pierce through him. It felt like that night at the field…
Heavens above. 
        Sibier blinked hard, his vision swimming. His enemy swung at him again, and he barely managed to block the strike, the clash of steel vibrating through his arms. His knuckles turned white as he gripped the hilt tighter, stumbling backward. His back hit a bag of grain, halting his retreat.
        </You> “You’ve never fought before,” the cultist sneered, his voice dripping with contempt. His lip curled as he took a step forward, sword raised. </Men like me> “Why are you even here?”
        Sibier gritted his teeth, the words hitting deeper than they should have. </Men like me> “I have fought before,” he snapped, though the conviction in his voice wavered. The memory of his first kill flashed before him—the man was ashen, lifeless and his skin cracked and hollow. His mouth dried as he relived the moment, his arm feeling weak. And then when Werrin had needed him the most, that terror had made him freeze…
        The cultist struck again, forcing Sibier to duck, the blade slicing through the air just inches above his head. The cultist pressed, yet Sibier swung his sword instinctively. Their blades connected, and the cultist grunted in pain. Sibier’s eyes darted to the knife still embedded in the man’s arm. The cultist backed away, his teeth gritted. 
        But this time, Sibier pressed the cultist. He swung again. Then again. And again. Each strike came heavier, sharper, more desperate. The cultist stumbled further back with every blow, his defense growing sloppy, his blade barely meeting Sibier’s. Growling, Sibier swung frantically, the rhythm of the fight overtaken by raw emotion. He knocked the weapon to the ground, and the cultist staggered, unarmed and wide-eyed.
        Sibier stood over him, his chest heaving, his sword raised high. The killing blow was just a heartbeat away, but his sword felt heavy in his hands and his insides squirmed. 
        It felt like something was caught in his throat, a disgusting feeling welling in his gut. It was like emptiness. The sense inside of him was revolting. His breathing slowed as his eyes locked onto the man beneath him. He could see the fear in the cultist’s gaze—fear he had felt himself once, trapped in Werrin’s cell, helpless and defeated. Sibier swallowed, hands raised high for the killing blow.
        Then, the ghost of the man Sibier had killed in the fields appeared in his mind. The image of those hollow, lifeless eyes and that cracked, blackened skin consumed him. Biting his lips, Sibier felt bile rise in his throat. His arm refused to move. The cursed hunger in his veins had quieted, replaced by something worse—emptiness. I can’t do it. I can’t kill him. 
        The cultist’s eyes flicked past Sibier, and the movement broke his paralysis. On instinct, Sibier ducked just as a shadowy, claw-like hand swiped over his head. A phantom—barely humanoid in shape, its dark tendrils swirling with malice—lunged at him.
Stumbling away from the phantom, Sibier was left unprepared. The cultist took his chance, slamming into Sibier and sending them sprawling to the ground.
Sibier rolled when he hit the ground, barely dodging the phantom’s attack. Kicking himself free of the cultist’s grasp, he scrambled to his feet, retreating toward Werrin’s remaining soldiers. Neither the cultist or the phantom pursued as Sibier’s heart pounded, his lungs burning as he gasped for air.
        Around him, chaos reigned. Four soldiers lay on the ground, bleeding and wounded, their groans of pain cutting through the cacophony of the fight. Werrin’s line was shattered, the remaining men struggling to regroup. Werrin himself was still on his feet, but just barely, blood streaming from his leg as he barked desperate orders. Around them, the phantoms surged -- even though half gone --ripping apart any unity his allies had. On the other side, the Darkened Dawn pushed forward, unrelenting. None of them had fallen. Not one.
        Sibier’s gaze darted back to the cultist he had fought. The phantom had attacked the cultist, who had recovered Sibier’s sword. With a growl, the cultist thrust the blade straight through the apparition. It dissolved into mist, only to reform moments later. But the cultist was persistent, swinging wildly, scattering the mist until it finally faded. 
Werrin’s voice cut through the chaos. </Sibier> “Sibier!”
The captain limped toward him, his hair plastered to his forehead with sweat. Blood streaked his face, his jaw clenched with pain. He thrust a sword into his hands, his face grim. His voice was sharp, commanding. </The High Executioner> “We can’t run. They’ve blocked the exit. Stand and fight.”
Sibier nodded mutely, his fingers wrapping around the hilt of the blade. The captain didn’t say anything more, but his expression spoke volumes: You froze again.
Sibier looked down at the ground, his stomach churning. He wanted to speak, to apologize, to explain, but the words wouldn’t come. His guilt was a stone lodged in his throat.
Werrin turned back to the fight, limping into the fray with his sword raised. Sibier watched him go, his chest tightening. The captain’s movements were slower now, his strength clearly waning. But still, he fought. He didn’t hesitate.
Sibier’s gaze flicked back to the cursed arm at his side, the faintest glow pulsing beneath his skin. He clenched his fist, his nails digging into his palm. Why can’t I be like him?
So many of their men had fallen, the phantoms had turned to attack the Darkened Dawn, giving Werrin the moment he needed to pull out the last two of their remaining men from combat, giving them space to regroup. 
But it was only seconds until the Darkened Dawn had dissipated what remained of the unstable phantoms. Like storm clouds approaching, the Darkened Dawn re-formed, their leader raising his blade. With a guttural roar, the cultists charged.
Sibier took a deep breath, steeling whatever will he had left to fight, and prayed to the stars. He could feel how the remaining three men besides him tensed, and could hear the beat of their hearts. Together they raised their swords, feeling as though their graves had already been dug.
And then, as if summoned by the stars themselves, the High Executioner arrived.



________________
Chapter Sixteen
</The High Executioner> “The Stars will Shine in the Day of Destruction”
























Trent barrelled into the cavern, Karia’s hand in his grip, pulling her behind him. Just like the old times.
The room erupted into chaos as the battle unfolded before him. Clashing steel, grunts of pain, and the barking of orders ricocheted off the stone walls, but Trent’s focus narrowed like a blade. Karia’s voice still echoed in his ears, her hurried explanation on the way here: a small team of her men had infiltrated the Darkened Dawn, but the men she had led away had turned back, bringing more forces.
That was all Trent needed to hear to send his soldiers charging through the unknown enemy barracks blind. It was enough. Enough because it was her. Because Karia had asked him.
He scanned the scene in an instant. Four men left standing against an army. The captain fought in the front, barely holding the line, his leg streaked with blood. A younger face lingered at the rear, his face pale, his sword shaking in his grip as a cultist bore down on him. For a moment, Trent's stomach churned, disturbed. He knew that face. He was that boy. The one from the Trials. The one he needed. Heavens above, how did he get here?
But Trent had no time to linger on that thought. His men poured in behind him, a wave crashing into the unprepared ranks of the Darkened Dawn. Trent surged forward, and his blade found its rhythm almost immediately. He stepped into the first strike as though born for it, parrying one cultist’s wild lunge and driving his blade home. He felt the familiar give of flesh, the resistance of bone, and the thud as the man crumpled. Another cultist swung at him, but Trent was faster, ducking under the blow and slamming his hilt into the man’s temple. The figure crumpled with a groan.
He fell effortlessly into step with Karia. Their movements felt instinctual, a synchronized dance of strikes and counters that reminded him of the old days. It was like breathing. They cut through the enemy ranks together, splitting the Darkened Dawn’s forces in two. For a fleeting moment, Trent almost smiled. This is what it was like before... Before the weight of the High Executioner’s mantle. Before his betrayal. Before the fractures in his soul had grown so deep that sometimes he barely recognized himself anymore. 
Trent gritted his teeth. He wouldn’t go back.
His gaze flickered to Karia, catching the way her auburn hair clung to her damp face, the determined fire in her eyes. She moved with precision, fierce and fluid, fighting with the same passion she had when he first meant her -- back before she was a talented killer. Trent felt a pang of something he couldn’t quite name—a yearning, maybe. Or regret. He wanted this again, this partnership, this rightness.
The clang of metal jolted him from his thoughts. The cultists were crumbling, retreating under the weight of his men. He pressed forward, his blade carving a path. When the tide of the fight broke, Trent found himself extending his hand to a fallen figure.
His breath caught as his eyes locked onto the boy’s face. He had in his eyes that same determination Trent remembered seeing the day he visited his family. That same fire he carried during those trials. It was the same passion Trent had once had… something he never thought could be extinguished.
The boy’s face twisted in fear as Trent hauled him to his feet, and Trent felt the sharp stab of guilt cut through him. The boy flinched at his touch, his gaze accusatory and penetrating. It didn’t matter that he’d been fighting for the rebellion at this moment. It didn’t matter that he’d just saved the boy’s life. To the boy, Trent was a monster.
Even now, after he had shed the High Executioner’s cloak in the forest hundreds of yards away, it still cast its shadow over him.
Trent pushed the boy toward the safety of Karia’s men and refocused, shaking off the lingering guilt. There wasn’t time for this. He reorganized Karia’s injured soldiers, calling out commands and rallying them to push back the last of the Darkened Dawn. Momentum surged through him, and the remaining cultists fell or surrendered within minutes.
When the last blade clattered to the ground, Trent finally allowed himself to breathe. The blood pounding in his ears slowed, and his grip on his sword loosened. Around him, the cavern fell into a tense, exhausted silence. The only sounds were the heavy breaths of the survivors and the distant drip of water echoing from the stone walls.
        Trent gazed around the room, taking in the aftermath. Ten of Karia’s men were down, several of them unmoving. His gut tightened, though his expression remained impassive. They had been Kingdom forces—good fighters, by the looks of them—and their captain was already crouched beside the wounded doing what he could to stop the bleeding. A good captain, Trent thought with approval.
        Realizing he hadn’t yet checked on his men, Trent glanced at them -- not a single one had fallen. He smirked. But I’m a better [bo]captain. 
        He stepped forward, his boots crunching against scattered debris and spilled grain. His hand came to rest on one of the burlap sacks beside him. The coarse fabric shifted under his fingers, the weight of the food inside palpable. His smirk faded as he took it in. So much food. Enough to end the riots. Enough to quiet the starving cries of children in the streets. Enough to make the kingdom whole again.
He swallowed hard, his throat dry. This was what they’d fought for. What he had fought for, once upon a time. The burlap sack beneath his palm was full of life: grains and kernels that could feed hundreds, perhaps thousands. It was the answer to so many prayers, the solution to so many nights spent staring into the hollow, hungry eyes of children.
But the sight didn’t fill him with the satisfaction he’d expected. Instead, his chest felt hollow, his heart sinking further with each passing second. The weight of the sack under his hand felt dwarfed by the heavier burdens pressing on his soul. This should feel like hope, he thought. Why doesn’t it?
Trent’s gaze drifted across the cavern, drawn like a magnet to the captain. The man moved with purpose, his sword sheathed, giving orders to all of the soldiers as they scrambled to assess their wounded. Blood slicked the floor around them, a grim reminder of how close this mission had come to disaster. The captain knelt beside one of his men, gripping the soldier’s shoulder, steadying him as another wrapped his bloodied leg.
        Why hadn’t I heard about this mission? The thought felt like a punch, as he narrowed his eyes His fingers curled into fists at his sides, and his jaw tightened. His eyes darted to Karia, her face drawn up in compassion as she crouched beside Sibier. She slipped her arm around the boy’s shoulders, lifting him to his feet.
The flash of anger came so fast it almost startled him. A bitter sting of betrayal seared through his chest. What was Karia planning to do with this food? He couldn’t stop himself from narrowing his gaze. His thoughts spiraled: Was she starting another rebellion without me? What was she doing with that boy?


But as suddenly as the fury had come, it vanished. Trent inhaled deeply, his grip loosening, but the tremor in his hands remained. His emotions felt like the wires from the Trials, sparking and snapping, barely contained. He fought to focus, fought to keep his thoughts from unraveling completely. Yet the pressure was suffocating, pressing against his chest, making his breaths shallow.
He clenched his teeth, trying to root himself in the present. Karia had brought me here, he told himself forcibly. We had worked together again. I could be the rebellion hero again! 
Those thoughts gained little traction, as his mind betrayed him. Can you? Snickered the High Executioner’s voice. Suddenly, the past came flooding back in his mind: he saw Icar’s face, cold and unyielding, his voice a low whisper that felt like the scrape of a blade against bone.
</Werrin> "Bring that boy to me."
Trent winced, his breath hitching.
</Werrin> "Bring that boy to me." Icar’s voice repeated in his head.  
Trent’s vision blurred, and his thoughts collided in a frantic storm. In his imagination, he saw Selean, pale and sickly, her small hand clutching Sasha’s. He could hear her labored breaths and could see the frailty in her eyes. He remembered the cruel bargain Icar had laid before him, the noose tightening around his family’s neck. I can’t fail them. Then his eyes shifted to Karia, who held her arm around the trembling boy. I can’t fail her either…
Trent’s hands began to shake uncontrollably. His stomach twisted into knots as his mind replayed Icar’s ultimatum over and over again. He closed his eyes, feeling the heat rise into his cheeks and the pressure building on his soul.
Trent staggered under the weight of it all, his jaw locking as a sharp, searing pain radiated through his chest. Without thinking, he thrust out his arm, his finger trembling but unwavering as it pointed toward Sibier. </Karia> “Arrest that boy,” he ordered, his voice devoid of empathy, cold and distant.
        The words hung in the air as no one moved. Karia met Trent’s eyes with a look of disbelief. Her arms fell to her side, letting go of Sibier. </Werrin> “Trent,” she croaked, her voice pleading. 
        </Werrin> “Trent’s resolve wavered for a fraction of a second. A flicker of doubt flashed in his eyes, but it was swallowed by a surge of anger. His composure shattered like glass, and his voice exploded with raw, unchecked fury. “BLAST IT!” he roared, his face contorted with rage. </Werrin> “ARREST THAT BOY!”
The room was silent. Then all at once, Trent’s men surged forward. 
        Then the captain stood, drawing his sword. </Werrin> “No one touches the boy.”

        Sibier held his breath. 
        Werrin stood firm, his sword drawn, a human shield between the High Executioner’s men and the boy they had come for. The gleam of his blade reflected the dim glowstone light, but it was the unwavering resolve in his stance that caught Sibier off guard.
A flicker of gratitude rose in Sibier’s chest, gradually rising in him like the first warmth of dawn. He’s protecting me, Sibier realized. Despite what he would’ve thought, Werrin was willing to stand his ground—for him.
        The soldiers hesitated, their collective gaze flickering between their captain and the High Executioner who stood as solemn as death itself. The High Executioner’s presence alone seemed to leach the warmth from the cavern, leaving Sibier’s skin prickling as though winter had swept into the room.
And then the memories hit.
Sibier swallowed hard as the past washed over him, vivid and unrelenting. He could still see the High Executioner standing over his parent’s broken forms, blade upraised. The High Executioner had let him escape then. He saved him from the trials. He had even lifted him up tonight in the midst of battle. Sparing him each time, Sibier was convinced, not out of mercy but to prolong his suffering. And now, here he was again. Sibier’s fingers twitched at his sides, wanting to curl into fists but shook too much to obey. It felt as though the High Executioner was everywhere, his shadow a plague that tainted Sibier’s dreams.
The silence was unbearable.
Sibier moved cautiously, taking a step back to stand behind Karia. Werrin’s men drew their swords in unison, their loyalty to their captain unwavering as they formed a protective line behind him. But the High Executioner didn’t even flinch.
The Executioner’s glare could have cut through steel.
        </The Rebellion Leader> “You soldiers,” he commanded, his voice as cold as the grave, </The Rebellion Leader> “are under my command now. Capture the boy, or I’ll kill every last one of you like the traitors you are.”
        Sibier’s throat tightened, his pulse hammering in his ears. He glanced at Werrin, expecting to see hesitation, but the captain didn’t budge or shift nervously like his men did.
</The Rebellion Leader> “The boy,” Werrin said, his voice steady and calm, </The Rebellion Leader> “is already under my command.”
Sibier blinked, surprised by the sheer conviction in Werrin’s tone. For all the distrust and unconscious bitterness Sibier had harbored against the captain, this moment gave him pause. Werrin wasn’t what he had thought. He wasn’t a traitor. He wasn’t selfish.
He was… something else entirely. He was the type of man that filled the Sogni dream. 
The High Execution stepped forward, his finger jabbing toward Werrin as his voice erupted like thunder. </Werrin> “CAPTAIN, DEFY ME AGAIN!” 
The words echoed in the cavern, slamming against the stone walls, and no one moved.
Then Trent’s eyes flicked to Karia.
</Werrin> “Karia,” he said, and his tone shifted, low and charged with something far more dangerous than rage. </Werrin> “Bring me the boy.”
The command wasn’t barked like the one Trent had issued to Werrin’s men. It wasn’t an order, not exactly. It was something heavier, something that clung to the air like smoke. A plea wrapped in authority, soaked in desperation and it sent a chill down Sibier’s spine.
        Instinctively, Sibier stepped away from Karia, fear coursing through his heart. His eyes darted to Karia, searching her face for a response. Her expression was unreadable, her lips pressed into a hard line. Then, her chin began to quiver. 
        Sibier took several more quick steps, entering deeper into the cavern belly to escape Karia. He remembered how she had defended the tyrant in their conversations. His throat went dry, unsure exactly who his friends were now. 
</Sibier> “Karia,” Trent said again, his voice softening. It was almost tender now, but Sibier knew better. </Sibier> “I need him. To save my family.”
The words hung in the air, heavy and raw.
</Sibier> “Don’t you love me?” 
The question was a blade of its own, sharp and precise, cutting through the already fragile silence. Sibier’s heart thundered in his chest as his gaze darted between Trent and Karia.
Her face betrayed nothing—not loyalty, not compassion, not anger. Her eyes almost looked empty, as if her guiding sense -- her soul  -- had been sucked out of her body and left her withered like a reed.  They were hollowed by too much pain, too much loss. Yet behind that void burned an intensity that mirrored Trent’s, a fire that refused to be extinguished.
        Sibier took another step back, but this time his foot bumped into the unforgiving cavern wall. His breath came in short, shallow bursts. He wanted to call out to her, to beg her not to listen, but the words caught in his throat.
And then Karia shifted.
Her gaze flicked to Sibier, and for a fleeting moment, he thought he saw something there—compassion, perhaps. Or maybe pity. She didn’t make a further move.
        Werrin didn’t let the moment drag on any longer. </Sibier> “I’m not moving,” he said firmly, his voice cutting through the suffocating tension like a blade. </Captain> “My men are taking the boy and this food.”
        One of Werrin’s soldiers shifted uncomfortably, stepping slightly to the side. </Captain> “Captain…” the man stammered, his voice barely audible.
        The High Executioner’s eyes snapped toward the soldier like a hawk spotting prey. </Captain> “This is your last chance,” Trent growled, low and venomous. </He> “Step aside.”
And one by one they all did.
        Werrin stood alone, facing the High Executioner. Even though the High Executioner hadn’t moved yet, suddenly he felt a lot closer. 
        The man who let me live. 
The monster who slaughtered my family. 
        Sibier bit his dry lips, his thoughts spiraling into chaos. His eyes darted toward the door—it wasn’t far, but it might as well have been miles. If he ran, Werrin’s men might try to stop him. And the High Executioner’s men… Sibier swallowed hard. He doubted they’d give him any mercy.
In a room packed with bodies, Sibier had never felt so alone. So trapped.
        The silence dragged on for a beat longer, the air bristling with unspent violence as the High Executioner finally drew his sword. The two squared off, each man reading the other, calculating. 
        Then the High Executioner lunged.
The sudden burst of motion made Sibier flinch. The High Executioner moved like a coiled spring, his blade slicing toward Werrin with a speed that seemed inhuman.
Werrin stumbled back, his sword rising just in time to meet the strike. Steel clashed against steel, the deafening sound echoing through the cavern like a thunderclap.
Sibier watched, frozen, as the scene unfolded before him. The High Executioner pressed forward with brutal efficiency, each blow heavy and unrelenting. Werrin gritted his teeth, his face red and his breathing ragged as he scrambled to parry. For a moment, it reminded Sibier of his father—how he had fought back against the High Executioner on the night of the massacre.
Sibier’s father hadn’t stood a chance.
Yet, Werrin regained his footing, grunting as he shoved back against Trent’s relentless fury. His face was red and bloodshot, his breathing heavy but he held his ground.
Something sparked in Sibier. This was his chance. This is what he needed. He bolted towards the door, ducking around a guard. They didn’t reach for him. He ducked low, skirting around the edge of the fight, his heart pounding so hard it drowned out the noise around him. He moved like a wild animal, desperate for freedom, his mind screaming for escape.
But his foot caught the edge of a grain sack. 
Sibier hit the ground with a hard thud, the rough stone scraping his palms and knees. Heat rushed to his face as frustration and fear tangled in his chest. Scrambling forward on his hands and knees, dread clawing its way up his throat.
And then he felt the High Executioner’s shadow loom over him. With a small step the High Executioner blocked his path, his dark eyes locking onto Sibier with a predator’s hunger. The world around him shrank to the space between them. Ten feet. It felt like inches. 
Pushing himself shakily to his feet, Sibier felt the bile rise in his throat. Dread filled him, thick and suffocating, like sewage water spilling into his lungs. He stood paralyzed, his limbs heavy, his gaze trapped in Trent’s cold, unblinking stare.
A few feet in front of the High Executioner, Werrin wiped the sweat from his brow, his chest heaving as he stole a few precious moments to breathe. Blood trickled from his lips as he coughed. But even then, Werrin didn’t falter. He glanced over his shoulder at Sibier, and in his wearied, bloodied face was something unexpected. A small, but reassuring nod.
And looking into Werrin’s face -- wearied, dirty, and exhausted -- Sibier felt guilty. This man doesn’t need to be fighting for me. The thought hit him like a hammer, leaving Sibier breathless. What am I to him? I can give him nothing of value. But despite that, Werrin hadn’t backed down.
Karia hadn’t helped him. Werrin’s own men had stood aside. And when Werrin had needed Sibier most, he had frozen. He had failed him too.
Guilt churned in Sibier’s gut, sharp and relentless. He cast his eyes to the ground, his fingers brushing against the cold hilt of a fallen sword.
His resolve hardened.
He gripped the blade, its weight anchoring him. The cold steel pressed against his palm, and he took a shaky breath as he looked up remembering when he had first fought the High Executioner. The night his father died.
The High Executioner smirked at him, almost curious. Biting his lip, Sibier stepped forwards but Werrin’s voice cut through the air.
Run, Sibier,” the captain ordered, his tone unyielding. His gaze never left Trent’s.
Sibier’s fingers tightened around the sword.
</Sibier> “Run,” Werrin repeated, his tone unquestioning, looking back at Sibier. </Sibier> “You won’t live this fight.”
Sibier met Werrin’s eyes, seeing the well of compassion there. Real, unyielding compassion. It wasn’t the hardened resolve of a soldier or the calculated look of a man weighing strategy. It was raw. It was human. Sibier felt tears come to his face, a hot sensation coming over him. It didn’t make sense. 
Stars above, Sibier thought from the bottom of his heart, bless this man! 
The High Executioner’s terse voice made Sibier flinch, wrenching the feeling of warmth with his bitter cold. </Karia> “Men,” the High Executioner commanded, </Karia> “get that boy.”
The High Executioner’s men stepped forwards. Werrin took a wary step back. Then, the men ripped their swords from their scabbards. Panic filled Sibier’s chest.
A hand grabbed Sibier from behind, and he screamed. He spun around, heart hammering, ready to fight. But instead of an attacker, he found one of Werrin’s men standing behind him—a reassuring presence. 
The man’s voice was low but firm, brimming with quiet courage. </Sibier> “We will fight for him,” he said, his words both a threat and a promise. He raised his blade slightly, meeting the High Executioner’s men with a glare. </Sibier> “You don’t want our blood on your hands.”
For a moment, the room froze. The High Executioner’s men faltered, their forward momentum halting. Their eyes darted between each other, then to the soldiers who now stood with Werrin. They outnumbered them, yes—but these were men who had bled together, who had fought side by side, who had trusted each other with their lives. Breaking that bond wouldn’t be as simple as drawing steel.
Sibier’s breath hitched in his chest. He watched in disbelief as Werrin’s men shifted into a protective formation around him, shields of flesh and steel. They didn’t have to. None of them had to. Yet here they were, risking their lives for him. For him.
Werrin smirked, a faint, almost imperceptible curve of his lips. He glanced at the soldier who had spoken, nodding slightly in approval. For the first time, Sibier felt a surge of what he felt when he saw Werrin with his family—admiration. This is the dream. These are the people I need for the dream. 
Seeing his men’s hesitation, the High Executioner’s face twisted with fury. </Karia> “I could have you all killed for this!”
Werrin scowled. </Karia> “That’s how you treat the men under you?” He scoffed, dry from his throat, a rasping sound that held no fear. </Sibier> “No wonder the rebellion failed.”
The High Executioner narrowed his eyes, venom filling his words. </Sibier> “You don’t know a thing, Captain,” he snarled, his voice low and dangerous. </Karia> “My sword points to Icar’s throat.”
</Sibier> “Then why didn’t you do it?” Werrin shot back, his voice rising. </Sibier> “You never wanted freedom. You never wanted to feed the people. You never cared about the people.” He stepped forward, his sword still raised but his words cutting sharper than any blade. </Sibier> “You only wanted power. And now you have it. So tell me, Trent—are you happy now?”
The room held its breath as the High Executioner froze, his expression unreadable. When the High Executioner finally spoke it was barely above a whisper, but carried the weight of a storm. </Karia> “You don’t know who you're talking about.” The High Executioner punctuated every word. </Sibier> “You don’t know who I am.”
The tension in the room was suffocating, the kind that made every breath feel labored. Sibier could see it—the shifting stances of the High Executioner’s men, their growing uncertainty. Some glanced toward Werrin, then back to Trent. The lines between sides were blurring.
Karia stood silent, with one hand resting on the hilt of her sword. Her body was poised like a lion ready to strike. She stared at Werrin with daggers in her eyes, but her lips remained tight.
And no one seemed to be paying attention to him anymore—or the door. Sibier’s eyes darted between the warring figures and his path to freedom, his breaths shallow and quick. He began to inch toward the exit, moving slowly, careful not to draw notice. If I can just slip out now… His heart pounded in his ears. I can run. Find Ilyian. Hide. Just run.
Werrin’s voice boomed through the cavern. </Sibier> “I think I got a pretty good idea of who you are,” the captain spat. </Karia> “You’re a traitor. To the people. To the kingdom. To her,” he said, nodding his head toward Karia who glared back at him. </Karia> “You only care about yourself.” He turned to the High Executioner’s men, his voice rising with conviction, as though daring them to defy their leader. </Karia> “And you’ll let every one of these men die. You won’t stop until you plant yourself on Icar’s throne!”
The High Executioner’s face darkened. </Karia> “You dare make me a villain?” He spoke evenly, somehow containing the emotion so close to bursting. </Sibier> “I have devoted my whole life to saving these people from men like you. Men who sacrifice their honor to join the kingdom’s forces so they can steal food from starving families for their own.”
The High Executioner’s men bit their lips at the remark, uncomfortable. A few glanced towards Werrin, uncertain who they should follow. 
</Karia> “Men like me?” Werrin shot back, his voice dripping with indignation. He pointed towards all of the soldiers in the room, nearly shouting. </Sibier> “Men like them?
“Men who only try to feed their families? Men who prevent riots from spilling blood in the streets? Not everyone in the kingdom is from the depths, like you!”
Trent’s hand went to his sword, but instead of lifting it, he hesitated. His chest heaved as he took a deep breath, his fiery anger dimming into something colder, something heavier. Instinctively Sibier froze, cautious. He had never seen this side of the High Executioner before. It wasn’t rage. It wasn’t cruelty. It was… clarity? It scared him more than the man’s fury ever could. Nervously, Sibier eyed the doorway which remained nearly twenty feet away. 
With the somber voice -- a voice that seemed crushed under the weight of a thousand sorrows -- the High Executioner responded. </Sibier> “Step aside, Captain.” He gestured toward Sibier with his sword, the blade a quiet threat. </Sibier> “I don’t want to have to kill you. You’re a good man.”
Sibier’s throat went dry. 
Werrin, however, only narrowed his eyes. </Sibier> “I’m not letting you have him. And if you attack me again,” he looked back to his men, </Sibier> “we’ll fight. We’ll gang up, and we will kill you.”
</Sibier> “Werrin…” Karia’s voice broke through, sharp but filled with emotion. There was an edge to her voice—almost a threat but like a warning.
The High Executioner didn’t look at her. His eyes remained locked on Werrin, unreadable and detached. </Sibier> “Even if you managed to kill me,” he said calmly, </Karia> “Icar would have you all hanged for treason. You can’t win that fight, Captain.”
</Karia> “Icar would celebrate us for killing the rebellion leader you are,” Werrin snarled. </Ilyian> “You aren’t the High Executioner. We don’t follow you.”
At those words, the Rebellion Leader gave a soft smile. He ran a hand through his hair, smoothing it. He squared his shoulder. His blue eyes seemed brighter, like they still held a spark of life in them. When he spoke, even his tone felt different -- whole, complete. 
</Ilyian> “Are you still trying to feed your family, Captain?” The words were soft, yet they cut like a knife. The Rebellion Leader took a step forward, and Werrin hesitated. </Ilyian> “To save them from starvation?
“Why does that matter?” he hissed, but his tone had lost its edge. </Ilyian> “Of course I want to save them!”
The Rebellion Leader’s voice dropped lower, colder, as he walked unafraid towards Sibier. </Sibier> “Then why won’t you let me save mine?”
The High Executioner's eyes locked with Werrin’s. </Sibier> “Then why don’t you let me save mine?”
The words hung in the air as Werrin fumbled for a response, gritting his teeth. For the first time, Sibier saw a crack in the captain’s resolve—not a weakness, but of uncertainty. 
Sibier’s heart raced as Trent took another step toward him, his movements slow and deliberate, blocking the only path towards escape. The tension in the room was suffocating, each breath Sibier took feeling like it might shatter the fragile balance.
Then Werrin lunged.
And the High Executioner became a tempest of steel.
His sword met Werrin’s with a deafening crash, the force of the blow echoing through the cavern. He spun, pivoting on his heel with a grace that didn’t match his bulk, redirecting Werrin’s blade to the ground. The captain stumbled, his feet skidding on loose gravel as the High Executioner loomed over him.  
Sibier sprinted for the door. 
Sibier’s breaths came fast and shallow, his feet pounding against the stone floor as though he were separate from his own body. He felt mechanical, his legs moving out of instinct rather than will. Just run. Just run.  
In a swift move, the High Executioner broke Werrin’s defense, sending the captain’s blade skittering across stone. The captain stumbled back, falling to one knee.
Sibier froze mid-stride, his heart screaming in his chest. The door was only feet away, just within reach, but the sight of Werrin on the ground, unarmed and vulnerable, rooted him in place. He saw the High Executioner raise his sword for the killing blow, the same cold, mechanical precision he had witnessed in his nightmares. In the back of his mind, he saw his father under that blade. 
I have to do something!
Sibier’s breath hitched. He reached for the knife in his scabbard, but he came up empty. Once again, he did nothing to save the captain who had sacrificed himself for him. 
The High Executioner’s blade came down.
Then Karia burst forward, her blade meeting the High Executioner's in a thunderous crash. The sound jolted Sibier, snapping him out of his paralysis.
</Sibier> “GO!” Karia shouted over her shoulder, her voice raw and urgent. Her blade quivered against the High Executioner's unyielding strength, her teeth bared in defiance. </Sibier> “RUN!”
Sibier didn’t wait to see what happened next. He raced toward the door, shoving it open with trembling hands. The storm outside howled in greeting, cold rain pelting his face as thunder rolled across the mountains. The wind whipped at his clothes, like that night before...
A dark chill crawled down his spine, as tears filled Sibier’s eyes.
The night his parents died.
He hadn’t looked back then. And heavens above, he wished he had. 
With tears blurring his vision, Sibier turned. Inside the cavern, the scene was chaotic. With a swift movement, the High Executioner kicked out Karia’s feet, sending her sprawling -- the same way the monster had sent Sibier’s mother to the ground. Hate boiled in Sibier.
Sibier’s hair whipped at his head, feeling the wind howl behind him. It was cold, but it was nothing compared to the heat inside of him. He felt that rage turn dark, feeding his bitterness. Feeding the raw desire to destroy. His skin crackled near his curse, the veins in his palms glowing a sinister violet. [bq]
The captain was on his feet again, his wrist twisted at an unnatural angle, his face pale and strained. He stumbled toward his fallen sword, his movements sluggish and pained. Yet, even now, there was something unyielding in his eyes.
</Karia> “Run, Sibier!” Werrin shouted, his voice hoarse but resolute. It cut through the chaos like a knife, piercing straight into Sibier’s chest. For a moment, the captain’s gaze locked with his, and Sibier saw something he had seen in his father’s eyes that night. Save our dreams, his Fathers voice echoed. Save Ilyian. 
With those thoughts, the hate drained out of him. Leaving him empty. Sibier felt sick. 
The High Executioner turned to Werrin, his face hardened and unreadable. Werrin lunged for his sword but with mocking ease the High Executioner kicked the blade away. The captain staggered back, his wrist cradled against his chest, but he didn’t retreat. He stood tall, his gaze steady, his breathing labored but unbroken.
</Sibier> “Heavens above,” Sibier whispered, feeling the cold bite of the weather in his skin, </Sibier> “don’t let this happen again.”
The High Executioner turned to Sibier, his face expressionless. He wore the same mask of death he had seen every night. In that gaze, Sibier felt so small, and the distance between them wasn’t far enough.
Five feet. 
The High Executioner lunged for Sibier, but Werrin jerked forward, catching the High Executioner’s leg. Roaring, the Rebellion Leader backhanded the captain, sending the man sprawling. </Ilyian> “Stay down, Captain,” Trent warned, his voice cold and heavy with regret. </Ilyian> “Don’t make me do this.”
Werrin didn’t listen. With his uninjured arm, he reached for a dagger strapped to his side and lunged at the High Executioner in a final act of defiance.
Sibier’s heart lurched as Trent stepped aside, catching Werrin’s wrist with precision. In a fluid motion, Trent twisted the captain’s arm, forcing him to drop the dagger. The blade clattered to the ground.
Trent shoved Werrin backward, and the captain stumbled, his foot catching on his own fallen blade. His head cracked against the stone behind him.[br]
The cavern fell silent, save for the sound of rain and Sibier’s ragged breathing. The captain didn’t move. 
Sibier’s scream tore through the cavern. He stumbled back into the storm, his legs weak, his vision swimming. His gaze darted between Werrin’s lifeless body and the High Executioner, who stood frozen, his sword lowered. </Karia> “HOW COULD YOU!” 
Trent closed his eyes, his hand clenching into a fist. He muttered something under his breath—too quiet for anyone to hear—before stepping away from Werrin’s body, and turning his haunted eyes back to Sibier.
        Sibier’s body moved before his mind could catch up. He bolted into the night, the storm swallowing him whole. The rain lashed against his skin, his tears mixing with the downpour. 
He’s everywhere, Sibier thought, his chest heaving with sobs. I can’t escape him. I can’t escape any of it.
He didn’t know where he was running. It felt as though the stars themselves had turned their backs on him, leaving him to stumble blindly through the storm. They had given him a second to stand and fight the High Executioner.
But once again, he had run.

Chapter Eighteen
</Karia> “On every coin there are two sides. One is hidden, and the other is shown.”


























The Captain didn’t move. 
Trent took a slow step backwards. The sickening grief welled inside him, slow and suffocating, like rot spreading through his chest. He didn’t dare look at Werrin’s lifeless body again. He couldn’t. The image was already burned into his mind.
His hands trembled at his sides, stained with blood that felt too hot and too familiar. Disgust pooled in his stomach, but it wasn’t enough to drown out the cold voice in the back of his mind. Focus. Don’t think. Don’t feel. Keep moving.
Trent clenched his jaw. That voice—no, that thing—was the High Executioner. It had been his shield, his weapon, his mask. It had been the reason he survived so much death, so much pain. But he hated it. That person wasn’t him. It was a hollow, merciless force. A void where his humanity should have been.
But grief was unbearable. Guilt unbearable. Emotion was unbearable. And the High Executioner made it all go away. He was a passionless killer. A machine. To it, only the mission mattered.
For a moment, Trent let the cold numbness creep over him like frost. He let himself imagine, just for a second, how easy it would be to push it all down and become the blade Icar needed again. It was tempting. It would be so easy.
But then Trent’s knuckles whitened around his fists, his nails biting into his palms. </Karia> “No,” he hissed to himself, the word barely audible. </Sibier> “I should feel this. I need to feel this. I killed him.” The Rebellion Hero would feel the pain. That was who he was.
The guilt hit him in another round. Trent ground his teeth until his jaw ached, fighting the urge to scream. He forced himself to turn away from Werrin’s body, focusing instead on the doorway where Sibier had fled moments ago. The boy had disappeared into the night, his escape punctuated by the reddish glow of bloodstained glowstone. Trent’s hands twitched with the instinct to chase. Run. End this. Do what you have to do. 
The High Executioner would. He wasn’t sure what the Rebellion Leader would do. Setting his jaw, Trent faced the storm. 
But then a voice tore through the air, raw and broken, freezing Trent mid-step.
</Sibier> “Trent!”
Karia.
Her cry shattered through his thoughts, through the haze of regret and the cold calculations of the Executioner’s mindset. Trent turned to see her collapse to her knees, her auburn hair falling around her face like a curtain. Her mouth hung open, trembling, and her wide, disbelieving eyes were fixed on him.
Then the plea came again, broken, begging, needing. </Terit> “Trent?” she whispered, her voice cracking beneath the weight of her anguish. The single word—his name—sounded like both a plea and an accusation.
He couldn’t breathe.
        </no one> “Karia…” he began, his voice soft, almost pleading, as he sheathed his sword. He stepped forward, his heart breaking at the sight of her.  </Terit> “I need to save my family.”
Her eyes narrowed, wet with tears, but her grief was already twisting into something sharper. She sniffed, dragging herself to her feet with slow, deliberate movements. </Terit> “At what cost, Trent?” she asked, her voice laced with a venom he hadn’t heard in years. </Terit> “Would you sacrifice me to save your family?”
        </Terit> “Karia,” Trent’s voice warned, </Sibier> “Don't go there.”
</Yorin> “Would you?” she pressed, stepping closer now, her grief giving way to fury.
</Yorin> “Of course not!” Trent broke, his voice cracking as he shouted. </Yorin> “I love you, Karia! I love you more than anything! But heavens above, I need to save my family!” His words came out in desperate, ragged bursts. </Terit> “They’re all I have left! Selean is sick, and I—I have no other choice!”
For a moment, Karia didn’t respond. She just stared at him, her face a storm of emotions he couldn’t read. Then, without a word, she stood, walking a wide arc around him, keeping her distance as though he were something dangerous. Her gaze never left his, but it wasn’t the gaze he remembered. The warmth was gone, replaced with something cold and cautious. It felt alien. 
She stopped by a pile of equipment, snatching up a bag one of Werrin’s men had packed. Slinging it over her shoulder, she finally spoke. </Sibier> “So now you like being Icar’s puppet?” Her words were bitter, dripping with disdain.
Trent flinched on those words, feeling nearly paralyzed by her agony. </Sibier> “No,” he whispered, his voice trembling. </She> “Karia, on the way here, I felt like myself again. Fighting alongside you, saving you—it felt like I was whole again. Like I was…”
Karia turned sharply, her eyes narrowing. </Sibier> “Like what, Trent?” she spat, interrupting him. </Sibier> “Like a real monster? Lying to the people you love and killing their friends?”
Trent swallowed, looking down at the corpse besides his feet. The blood on his hands felt hot, searing him. His breath came in shallow, uneven bursts as he hit his side—where Karia’s knife had scarred him.
Once.
Twice.
Again.
And again.
Each strike was a punishment, but it wasn’t enough. The wound of Karia’s words went far deeper than her knife had. His chest heaved as he opened his mouth to speak, to deny Karia’s words, to beg her forgiveness, to say something—but nothing came out. His throat was raw, and the words twisted into nothingness.
Karia didn’t wait for him to find the words. She turned on her heel, her boots crunching against the stone as she headed for the door. But just before she disappeared into the storm, she stopped and her shoulders stiffened. </Her> “You’re not the man I fought for,” she said quietly, words almost hollow. </Sibier> “And you’re not the man I loved.”
She stepped out into the night.
The words punched Trent square in the chest, knocking the wind from him. He staggered forward, reaching for her retreating figure like a man drowning in the depths reaching for a lifeline. </Sibier> “Karia!” he called out, his voice trembling, cracking under the weight of his desperation.
She didn’t turn.
</Sibier> “Karia, wait!” Trent’s tears blurred his vision as he stumbled closer, the storm outside spilling in and soaking him to the bone. His voice was ragged, trembling with his desperation. </She> “I’m scared of who I am when I’m not with you.”
Karia froze, her back to him. Trent could feel her anger. He wanted to hide from it. He wanted to escape the crushing guilt. He wanted to disappear from all the warring emotions inside of him. He wanted… he wanted to be the High Executioner again.
        But he couldn’t.
</She> “Karia,” Trent pleaded, </Sibier> “I need you to save me.”
Karia’s posture remained rigid. The wind tore at the Darkened Dawn cloak she still wore, similar to the one from her father’s shop. She looked just as torn as that night Trent had first found her. 
For a moment, she didn’t move. Trent’s heart hammered in his chest as he stepped closer, his voice breaking. </Sibier> “Please, Karia. Help me bring back the boy. We can end the Trials. We can save my family. We can save everyone.” 
Karia kept her back to him.
Trent’s voice grew more frantic, more raw with every word. </Sibier> “Karia, please don’t leave! Please, won’t you just save me? Trent? The man you love?”
His words hung in the air, and for the briefest of moments, Trent thought they had reached her. Her shoulders slumped ever so slightly, the tension bleeding from her body. Slowly, tentatively, she turned.
Her green eyes were wide, her lips trembling as though she wanted to say something but couldn’t find the words. Rain streamed down her face, mingling with tears that Trent wasn’t sure she even realized were falling.
Trent extended his hand, his fingers shaking. </Sibier> “Karia…” His voice was barely above a whisper now, softer, pleading. </She> “Please[bs].”
Karia met Trent’s eyes. Tentatively, her hand inched forward, trembling as if caught between two forces pulling her in opposite directions. When their fingers finally brushed, Trent felt a flicker of warmth—a spark of life, a whisper of hope. He needed to feel her forgiveness.
Karia pulled her hand away. 
Her grip tightened around the bag of equipment by her side, as she took a step back--away from Trent. Her words came stitched together between dry gasps of breath. </Sibier> “I’ll save you Trent,” Karia choked, her voice unsteady, barely audible over the storm. She continued to pull away, her form becoming more and more a shadow as the distance between them grew. </Sibier> “But I can’t until you kill the High Executioner.”
Karia vanished into the storm.
And Trent sank to his knees, her words ringing in his ears.

Chapter Sixteen
























Wide-eyed, Sibier burst into the abandoned rebel outpost, rainwater dripping from his hair and pooling at his feet. Terit cursed behind him from where he kept watch, but Sibier didn’t stop to explain himself. His chest burned, and his heart raced, each step feeling heavier than the last. His wild, uneven breaths matched the storm outside as he tore through the narrow hallways, slipping on wet stone.
He stumbled into the dimly lit back cave, nearly tripping over Yorin’s sleeping form sprawled against a pile of blankets. Sibier didn’t even glance at the captive Darkened Dawn member, bound and unconscious in the corner. There was only one person he needed to see.
Sibier found Ilyian’s small, curled form in the far corner of the room. Bless the skies. The boy was tangled in a thin, patched blanket, his face pale and damp with sweat. He was restless, twisting and turning in his sleep. One small arm reached out into the darkness.
 </Sibier> “Momma,”  Ilyian whimpered, his soft voice breaking like a fragile note. </Sibier> “Don’t leave...”
Darting across the room, Sibier lifted his brother out of his bed and cradled him in his arms. He pulled Ilyian’s face close to his chest, like he did that night his parents were murdered. Like his brother, Sibier couldn’t get them out of his mind. 
Ilyian startled awake, blinking groggily before recognizing his brother’s face. He immediately reached up and wrapped his small arms tightly around Sibier’s neck, holding on like a lifeline. </Sibier> “I miss Momma,” he said.
Sibier clenched his jaw so tightly it ached, crying as he thought about the stars above. He couldn’t respond, not immediately. Skies, how could he respond? He was just a boy himself. He didn’t feel capable of raising Ilyian. He barely felt capable of keeping them alive.
Ilyian continued. </She> “I miss Dadda too. I want them home!”
Sibier closed his eyes, ignoring everything else besides the feeling on his younger brother’s cheek against his. </Sibier> “They went to their home before they lived here,” he said softly, his words meant as much for himself as for Ilyian. </She> “They’re with the stars now.”
Ilyian pulled back slightly, just enough to look into Sibier’s tear-streaked face. His own eyes were red and puffy, his lip trembling. </She> “I want to go there.”
Sibier choked, resting his hand on Ilyian’s back. </Sibier> “You can’t go there yet. Mom and Pa wouldn’t want you too.”
Ilyian frowned but was silent, sniffling as he pressed his cheek against Sibier’s chest again. His little body trembled with quiet sobs, and Sibier held him tighter, rocking him gently like their mother had once done for both of them.
They stayed there for several moments, before he heard Karia break through. </Sibier> “Sibier! Are you here? We need to go!”
Sibier ignored Karia, focusing on his brother’s breaths against his neck. He needed this moment, this break, this comfort. He closed his eyes, seeing his parents there with them. He could smell the honey in his mom’s breath, could feel the callouses in his dad’s hands as he imagined them in the embrace as well. </Sibier> “Can you see them Ilyian,” Sibier whispered. </She> “They’re here too.”
</Sibier> “I know,” Ilyian whispered. </Sibier> “I see them when I sleep.”
Karia entered the room, her eyes narrowing when she saw Sibier and Ilyian, motionless. </Sibier> “Sibier!” she said, exasperated her voice full of rage. </Sibier> “We need to go!” 
Sibier took a deep breath, not looking at Karia. 
Then Karia reached out, grabbed his arm, and pulled them along. 


*
*[bt] Section Break *

Pushing aside overgrown branches, Karia revealed a rusted hatch half-hidden beneath tangled roots and moss. Her voice, sharp and clipped, held the familiar bleakness Sibier had grown used to over the past few days since the battle. </Sibier> “We’re here.”
        Ilyian shifted against Sibier’s back, his tiny arms wrapped around his brother’s neck like a scarf. Sibier tickled one of his small hands with his finger, forcing a smile despite the dull ache in his chest. </Sibier> “Hear that, Ily?” he whispered to his brother. </Sibier> “We made it.”
        </Sibier> “Finally,” Terit added sourly. 
        Sibier frowned but didn’t respond. Terit’s pessimism had been relentless since the battle, and it grated on Sibier like a whetstone on a dull blade. His constant grumbling only seemed to amplify the silence Karia had left in her wake. She barely spoke these days, her icy demeanor thick with a barely caged intensity. And Yorin—usually the quiet but optimistic one—had retreated further into himself, a shadow of his usual self.
        The air between the group felt poisoned, and Sibier’s patience was thinning. Their misery hung heavy like a storm cloud, and no one seemed interested in lifting it. Instead, they passed it around, a disease they all carried, infecting each other.


At least Ilyian hadn’t caught it.
        With hollow eyes, Sibier watched Karia open the hatch. A second later, Karia disappeared into the chamber, as did Terit and Yorin. Sibier stepped down, blinking to adjust to the dim lighting. The carved-out chamber below was massive, sprawling in all directions like a buried giant’s tomb. Supplies were scattered across the floor in heaps—sacks of grain, coils of rope, even rusted tools. A few doorways branched off into smaller passageways, disappearing into the darkness.
        Karia moved silently ahead, her boots crunching softly on the ground as she set down a bag of equipment near the edge of the chamber. Sibier followed, his footsteps heavy. Ahead, the cavern opened onto a sheer cliff letting in natural light, where the salty air of the ocean greeted him. He shifted Ilyian’s weight and walked to the edge, peering over the drop.
The water churned violently below, white foam crashing against jagged rocks. Sibier’s stomach turned at the height. He bounced Ilyian gently on his back, steadying himself.
        Sibier sighed, taking a step back. He peered at the seaweed that dropped out in front of him, their long green stalks swaying back and forth gently from the overhang. None were within reach, but even still, Sibier felt like he could reach out and touch one. 
        Taking a step back, he inspected the equipment Karia had dropped by the edge—harnesses and rigging ropes. He ran his fingers over the coarse material, his mind wandering. This is where we start, Dad. He imagined his father standing beside him, pointing out to the horizon as he spoke about their future. He could almost feel the warmth of the fire on his hands, hear the pride in his father’s voice as he described the dream: thousands would come, seeking refuge. There would be food in abundance, piled high for the hungry. No one would be turned away. </Its> “We’ll build a kingdom as if it resided in the stars itself.”


The memory brought a faint smile to Sibier’s lips. Maybe it could still be more than just a dream.
        But the moment didn’t last.
        </I> “What a blasted mess this is,” Terit grumbled, dragging Sibier back to the present. He and Yorin approached, their presence breaking the quiet like a hammer on glass. </Sibier> “This place has got fifty rooms and not a single blasted bathtub.”
        Sibier stiffened, his jaw tightening. Really? He gritted his teeth as Terit continued, seemingly oblivious to the frustration it drew out of Sibier. The fear, anger, and guilt hadn’t left him. The death of his parents. It felt like his fault. The death of Werrin… Heavens above. 
        </Sibier> “And this view?” Terit motioned toward the cliff, wrinkling his nose. </I> “Blocked by all this blasted seaweed. And it smells like—”
</Terit> “Yorin,” Sibier cut in sharply. Yorin’s eyes widened slightly at the interruption, but he didn’t protest. </Terit> “Can you watch Ilyian for a bit? I need some fresh air.”
        At this, Yorin brightened, a rare flicker of light breaking through his otherwise somber demeanor. Sibier had noticed how Yorin treated Ilyian—like the boy was a king, a treasure he could never replace. It made sense now. During their three-week journey to the rebel outpost, Sibier had learned Yorin’s story.
Yorin had once been a soldier of the Kingdom, stationed on a distant island far from his family. But misplaced trust in a scheming officer had destroyed his life. Caught in a plot he never understood he was thrown into prison for five years. Every day of those five years, Yorin read from the ancient texts, holding onto the fragile hope that his wife and young toddler would forgive him. Every day, he prayed that somehow they would find food to eat even when his pensions stopped coming.
When his time was served, Yorin came home to find his house occupied by strangers. His family was gone, vanished into the folds of time like smoke in the wind. He had searched for them for a year, spending every last coin he had, growing hollow from grief and desperation. By then, he was a traitor to the Kingdom for abandoning his post, and it was Terit—a man just as broken as he was—who found him wandering aimlessly. They wandered for nearly a year together before meeting Sibier.
To Yorin, Ilyian wasn’t just a boy. He was a fragile echo of the son he had lost, a second chance to protect something pure.
        </Sibier> “Consider him safe and sound until you return,” Yorin said, taking Ilyian gingerly underneath the arms. He held him carefully, his eyes never leaving Ilyian’s. </Sibier> “May you grow up to see the stars light,” he whispered to Ilyian, quoting scripture. 
The words struck a chord deep in Sibier’s chest, tugging at memories of his mother. She had whispered those same words to him on sleepless nights, her voice soothing against the chaos of their crumbling world. For a fleeting moment, the bitterness and frustration that had knotted Sibier’s soul loosened.
But the spell broke as Terit muttered, </Terit> “Hmm, back to the fancies of crazed old men.”
The sarcasm struck Sibier like a stone, sharp and unwelcome. He clenched his jaw, saying nothing, but his hands tightened into fists at his sides. Without a word, he turned away, his frustration too raw to keep simmering. He needed to escape. To breathe. To think. 
Exiting the rebel outpost, Sibier navigated the grove of trees in silence. The cool air nipped at his face as he climbed a small hill, the path narrowing until it opened onto a cliff. He pushed through the thinning trees, their canopy giving way to the open sky.
And there they were.
The stars.
Sibier stood still for a moment, the celestial expanse stretching endlessly above him. Their silvery light poured down like rain, washing over his skin. He let it soak into him, closing his eyes as he inhaled the cool night air. It filled his lungs, the sensation refreshing.
He dropped onto a nearby rock, tilting his head to the heavens. Above him, the stars stretched out in an endless expanse, captivating and mesmerizing. They had seen hundreds be born and die, witnessed every heartbreak, watched every moment of joy. Compared to them, Sibier felt like nothing—just a flicker of life, a single breath in the endless cycle of time.
The words of his mother echoed in his mind, soft and unwavering. No sparrow in the sky falls save they know it. 
But could they really see and hear all? Sibier wondered. Then why did they let my parents die? Werrin? 
A subtle, unspoken warmth began to flow over him, quiet and steady, like a stream washing over jagged stones. It didn’t answer his questions, but it eased the storm raging within him. He turned his eyes higher, speaking to parents in his mind. Am I fulfilling your legacy? 
Expectantly, Sibier waited but there was only silence. 
Sibier took in a deep breath, letting it lift his shoulders up and fill his chest. I failed, Sibier realized, didn’t I? I didn’t get the food. I let Werrin die. I ran again. 
The silence continued to stretch on. His hands trembled as he gripped his knees, the weight of his guilt pressing down on him.
Please, Sibier begged, the starlight catching the tracks of his tears. Let me try again. Forgive me. Let me fulfill the dream. Let me become your Legacy!
The heavens were still silent, but the peace within him lingered, stronger now. A thought rose unbidden, as if whispered by the stars themselves. I didn’t fail. I got the equipment.
Sibier furrowed his brow at the thoughts, his gaze distant as he tried to grasp the weight of those words. They didn’t feel like his own. The thought reverberated in his mind, filling the hollowness in his chest. So what should I do? 
This time, the answer came swiftly—unexpectedly so. I didn’t go to the Trials for nothing.
His breath hitched, his chest tightening. Slowly, Sibier rolled up the sleeve of his cursed arm. The faint violet glow of his veins pulsed faintly in the moonlight. He stared at the marks, seeing them with new eyes, like a map he hadn’t known how to read until now.
What does it mean? He wondered. 
The stars above gave no reply, but the feeling of peace swelled in his chest. It was enough. Sibier let his shoulders drop as he gazed over the horizon, breathing in through his mouth, releasing it softly through his nose.
His father’s dream echoed in his memory—a refrain of hope, whispered to him on cold nights by the fire. We’ll build a place for them, Sibier. The people will come because they’ll need somewhere to go. Somewhere to belong. But someone must lead them.
Sibier let the words take root. His father had been right. People would come, but they needed someone to follow. Someone strong. Someone who spoke with conviction. Someone with authority.
Someone who had survived the Trials. 
Goosebumps ran down Sibier’s skin, his arm tingling.  The cursed veins on his arm shimmered faintly as he stared at them. For the first time, he didn’t recoil. The curse wasn’t just a scar or a punishment. It was proof. Proof that I survived.
He could do it. He had what he needed—he could accomplish his family’s dream. He could lead the people. He could build a kingdom that would fit in with the stars.
The trees whistle in the wind, their song soothing. The sound soothed him, carrying his stress away like a river dragging silt downstream. Sibier blinked at the gentle rustle of leaves, the steady rhythm of his heartbeat in his ears.
Then he heard it. A quiet sobbing.
        Sibier tensed, leaning into the noise. It wasn’t far. Rising to his feet, he moved lightly, his steps soft on the damp dirt.


The sobs grew louder as he pushed through the thicket. Then, he saw her.
        Huddled against a gnarled tree was a girl—young, maybe seventeen—her fragile frame trembling. Bruises marred her pale skin, and faint scrapes lined her arms like shadows of pain. Goosebumps dotted her freckled flesh, and her teeth chattered as she pulled a torn jacket tightly around herself. It was barely a jacket anymore, just a tattered piece of fabric clinging to her like a dying promise.
Tears clung to her glossy green eyes, streaking down her dirt-smeared cheeks. A deep, rattling cough escaped her lips, the sound puffing into the cold night air like smoke.
Sibier froze. Something about her—something in her haunted eyes—reminded him of himself. Of the night he had run from the High Executioner, leaving everything he loved to burn behind him. The agony that lingered in her face mirrored the sticky fear still rooted in his soul.
        He crouched down beside her, carefully pulling off his trenchcoat. The fabric was worn and stained, but it was warm. </Terit> “Here,” he said, his voice soft, </Sibier> “take this.”
        The girl flinched at his approach, her eyes haunted.She looked at the coat in his hands, but didn’t reach for it. </Terit> “Please… leave me alone,” she whispered, her voice hoarse and trembling.
        Sibier’s heart tightened, his hand faltering as he held out the coat. He could see the pain written all over her—the fresh bruises, the raw wounds, the way her voice cracked like brittle glass. She couldn’t have been on the streets for more than a week. Her face still carried the remnants of someone who had known love, who had known a home.
His mother’s voice whispered in his mind again, gentle and firm. No sparrow falls save they know it.
        </Terit> “I don’t want to hurt you,” Sibier said softly, keeping his voice low and steady. He extended the coat again, his arm barely moving. </Yorin> “Please. You need this more than I do.”
        Her wary eyes flickered between him and the coat. Tentatively, her fingers wrapped around the edge of the cloth, but she didn’t put it on. Instead, her voice brittle. </Yorin> “What do you want?”
        Sibier let out a slow breath, a sad, tired smile curving his lips. </Sibier> “Right now?” he paused, thinking. </Sibier> “What I want doesn’t matter.” His voice softened even further, his eyes searching hers. </Terit> “Has anyone asked you what you want?”
The girl froze. The question hung in the air, as her lips began to tremble. </Terit> “No,” she whispered, almost inaudible.
        Sibier sat down beside her, his body angled slightly away, giving her space. He didn’t push. Instead, he let the silence settle between them, punctuated by the steady drip of water echoing through the grove. The quiet wasn’t heavy or awkward—it was necessary, cleansing. Sibier’s heart felt light, freer than it had in weeks.
And in that silence, realization washed over him. The fear, the guilt, the rage that had gripped him so tightly since the Trials—it wasn’t there. For the first time in what felt like forever, it was just… peace. A fragile, but growing peace.
This is how we save ourselves, he thought, marveling at the revelation, By leaving ourselves behind. By choosing to help someone else, instead of drowning in our own pain.
And suddenly, it was clear. This was why he was here. It wasn’t just his parents’ dream he was fulfilling; it wasn’t just a promise made to ghosts. This—this moment of connection, of offering something real to someone who needed it—this was the reason.
It was the way forward. It was the Sogni Legacy. 
It was his legacy. 
        The girl broke the silence first. Her voice was raw, like the sound of stone grinding against stone. </Ilyian> “Why are you out here? This isn’t where people live.”
Sibier tilted his head, meeting her gaze gently. </Ilyian> “I could ask you the same thing,” he replied, his tone calm but inviting.
</Terit> “Answer my question.”
Sibier turned his eyes skyward, the stars shimmering faintly through the canopy. He exhaled through his nose, feeling the cool night air fill his lungs. Oh stars above, how do I help her?
</Terit> “I came here for safety,” he said finally, the simplicity of the truth settling in his chest.
        Reaching out, Sibier rested his hand lightly on her arm. His touch was soft, careful, like his mother’s had been when she used to comfort him. The girl tensed at first, but then her shoulders relaxed, her breathing evening out. </Sibier> “You haven’t been out here very long, have you?” he asked.
        She nodded, her wide eyes locking with his.
        </Sibier> “Same here,” Sibier admitted. </Sibier> “My parents… they were murdered nearly two months ago.” His hand unconsciously tugged at his sleeve, pulling it farther down to hide the cursed veins. </Terit> “I understand how this feels.”
        For a moment, the girl said nothing. Then, slowly, she leaned into him, resting her head against his arm. She began to sob, her small frame trembling. Sibier didn’t move. He simply held her, letting her tears soak into his shirt. Her heartbeat pressed faintly against his skin, a fragile rhythm that grounded him.
        </Sibier> “You don’t have to continue living this way,” Sibier said softly after a moment. </Sibier> “Come with me. Help my friends and me build something new—a place where there’s enough food for everyone. It won’t be easy,” he added, his voice filled with quiet conviction, </Terit> “but it’ll be a life worth living.”[bu]
        The girl turned her tear-streaked face up to him, her chin quivering. </Sibier> “You… remind me of my brother,” she said softly, her voice thick with emotion.
        Sibier gave a soft smile. </Terit> “I imagine you miss him.”
        The girl only nodded, with tears in her eyes. 
        </Sibier> “Where is he now?”
        Her expression crumpled, and she shook her head. Her hands clenched into fists, tightening and relaxing over and over. </Sibier> “I… I don’t know,” she stammered. 
        Sibier’s heart ached for her. </Sibier> “Well,” he said quietly, </Sibier> “maybe we can find him together.” The words felt natural, something his father might have said in his stead. For the first time in weeks, Sibier felt fully connected to his parents’ dream, as though their legacy was truly alive within him.
</Sibier> “What’s your name?” he asked gently.
The girl hesitated, her voice catching before she finally answered. 
</Sibier> “Selean.”

Chapter Twenty-Eight
To those consigned to the depths, it will be their mercy
























I’ll save you Trent, but I can’t until you kill the High Executioner…
Those had been Karia’s last words to him.
Standing on a rocky shoreline, Trent stared down at the restless water, his face blank, save for the shadow in his eyes. The waves licked at the rocks below him with deceptive gentleness, but he knew better than to trust the sea. This was one of the few places in the kingdom where the island’s edge still dipped below the waterline, where the cliffs gave way to something more fragile: stones worn smooth by time, broken and shaped by the tide.
It was dangerous here, where the sea didn’t just kiss the land — it devoured it. Most people avoided this place, but that only made it better for Trent. He didn’t want people.
He wanted to be alone.
        Alone. Isolated. At the mercy of the sea. 
        The air was damp with the spray of the ocean, and the breeze rolled over him, chilling his bare feet against the cold stone. He had stripped away anything that even looked like it belonged to the High Executioner, anything that carried the scent of death and power. The salt stung at the cuts on his legs, but not nearly as much as the ache in his chest.
        Skies, Karia…
He stopped pacing, looking out at the horizon where the sky bled into the sea. She felt like family. And now she was gone.
Hadn’t I tried to mend what I broke?
The questions ate at him, gnawing at the edges of his sanity. Didn’t she love me?  Why couldn’t she forgive me? He scowled and started pacing again, trying to work the answers out of the stones beneath his feet. But there were no answers here. Only pain.
Trent stepped deeper into the sea, letting its chill cause goosebumps to run up his skin. He couldn’t bear to think of her face — her fury, her disappointment, the cold finality of her words. 
And then there was his family.
Trent froze. He didn’t dare think about them. Would they abandon me too?  He sniffed, his stomach queasy. Were they ashamed of who I have become? What would they think if they knew the things I have done? He squinted, forcing himself to think about them.
Sasha. He could almost see her face now, her quiet strength cracking under the weight of what she’d heard. She wouldn’t scream, wouldn’t cry — she’d just hold it all inside, like a dam about to burst. Her silence would be deafening.
And his father? Trent shuddered, picturing him sitting in his creaky old chair, with his brow twitching and hands to his head. His fingers would scratch at his slabs, all the while muttering to himself. </Sibier> “That’s no son of mine.” Then the pause. </Sibier> “That's no son of mine.”
His mother would try to smile — she always did. But it would be the kind of smile that hurt to see. A brittle, half-hearted thing, as if she were hugging something rotting, something too far gone to save...
And Selean? Stars above, Selean…
Trent crumbled under the weight of the thought. His fiery, rebellious little sister, who had always looked at him like he was a hero. The way she’d pump her fists in the air, shouting his name with all the passion and pride of someone who truly believed in him. He could see her face now, the fire in her eyes dying when she learned the truth. Her hero’s a butcher. The High Executioner.
His knees wobbled, and he fell to the rocks, his hands gripping the jagged edges until they bit into his palms. </My> “Skies, I didn’t want this!” he shouted, his voice raw and hoarse. The water churned about him, as if mocking him.
He slammed a fist into his side — once, twice, again — where Karia’s blade had pierced him. The ache flared, and for a moment, it distracted him from everything else. From the betrayal, the loss, the endless spiral of guilt. But even that couldn’t last.
He threw up his hands, his head tilted back toward the heavens. </My> “To the depths with it all!” he roared.
The wind stole the words from his mouth and carried them out to sea, where they sank like stones. Trent sat there for a long moment, his breath ragged, his fists trembling in his lap. He didn’t want to be the High Executioner. He didn’t want to be the rebellion leader, or Icar’s puppet. He just wanted to be Trent.
But that man… that man was long gone.
The waves swirled in front of him, a restless rhythm of temptation. The ocean whispered to him, its voice laced with dark promises. It would be so easy to surrender, to throw himself into the depths and let it all fade away. No more guilt. No more anger. No more Karia…
Trent stumbled forward, the rocks sharp beneath his feet. The cold spray of the sea bit at his skin as he sank deeper into the waves, the wind buffeting his body as if daring him to take the final step. The stars wouldn’t welcome him among their ranks, he was sure of that. But the stars didn’t matter anymore. Nothing mattered.
        </Others> “Please,” he whispered, his voice a strangled croak, barely audible over the growing roar of the ocean. </a burly man with wild eyes> “No more thoughts. No more feelings. Just… silence.”
        But no matter what Trent did, he couldn’t silence his memories. They came like waves, each one heavier and more relentless than the last, threatening to drag him under.
        Icar’s threat. The look in Sibier’s parents’ eyes before he cut them down. The man he had killed during the Trials. The captain’s blood pooling at his feet.
        Karia.
That singular tear trailing down her cheek as she disappeared into the storm. That tear haunted him more than all the screams of the dying.
He gasped for air, choking on his grief, but it was like drowning — each memory crashing over him like seawater, cold and suffocating. Break the heavens, just let it stop!
Trent clutched his sides, his nails digging into his ribs as he rocked back and forth. Where lurked relief? Where hid happiness? Where was joy?
The ocean answered, its icy touch brushing against his face as if it had crawled closer to meet him. The depths stretched out before him, vast and empty. He could end it all here. He could stop the tide of guilt, regret, and failure.
The salt spray stung his eyes as he blinked at the crystalline waves, their surface rippling with innocence, purity. They felt… untainted. Removed from everything festering inside him. Somehow, the ocean existed outside of pain. Outside of judgment.
Trent wiped the salt from his cheeks — though he wasn’t sure if it was from the sea or his own tears. He let the wind scream around him, the ocean whispering its promises of peace.
And for a moment, he believed it. 
The cold water rushed up to his stomach as he stepped further into the surf, his legs trembling beneath him. He shivered as the icy tide climbed higher, the sensation a jarring contrast to the fire raging inside his chest.


But as he stared at the endless horizon, a thought surfaced, unbidden, fragile yet unyielding.
Not yet.
        He stepped back from the water, his movements hesitant, his breaths shallow. He wasn’t sure if it was hope, or fear, or some other emotion too tangled to name, but something tethered him to the shore. Something kept him standing, even as his knees threatened to buckle again.
He had more to do. More to face.
But that thought didn’t bring him comfort. It wasn’t resolve. It wasn’t triumph.
It was just weight.
Trent turned away from the ocean, the rocks digging into his feet as he climbed back toward the land he didn’t know if he could endure.
A sound fractured the calm.
It wasn’t the gentle rush of waves against stone, nor the whisper of the wind that usually accompanied the sea’s quiet song. This was different—rough, deliberate, jarring. Wood smashing against water, forceful and persistent, like the sea itself was being challenged. Trent’s ear twitched. He froze, straining to hear. Then he saw it.
</Others> “Break the heavens,” he whispered. His eyes narrowed as he rubbed them in them in disbelief. </Others> “Impossible.”
Out on the open ocean, cutting through the waves like a defiant predator, was a boat. A wooden sea craft.
Trent had never seen one before, but the legends resurfaced instantly, gnawing at the edges of his thoughts. Stories of fools daring to voyage into the sea’s unforgiving embrace. None returned, though fragments of their vessels sometimes washed ashore as grim reminders of their fate.
Men couldn’t survive the ocean.
No one survived the depths.
But it wasn’t a man guiding the boat.
        A figure loomed at the prow, its grotesque silhouette framed by the moonlight. Human-like, but wrong. Its skin was a blistered, unnatural black, as though scorched by flames that had seared away its humanity. Purple veins pulsed like rivers of poison beneath its flesh, visible even from this distance.
Trent’s stomach turned. He couldn’t look away. The thing stood upright, confident, tugging a strange cover over the boat like it was sheathing the vessel itself.
The craft plunged into a wave and vanished beneath the surface. For a moment, Trent thought it was gone.
But then it burst back into view, breaking free of the water. The boat climbed the waves, shattering their crests with a power that felt unnatural. And the figure remained steady, its movements eerily precise as it manipulated the boat with a calculated efficiency.
Trent blinked, feeling his throat go dry. That skin. He knew what it was. 
Sibier.
        The thought struck like a thunderclap. Sibier’s cursed arm had the same charred texture, the same glowing veins. But this... this was different. Sibier’s mark had been limited to his arm, but this figure—this thing—was entirely consumed by it.
Trent’s breath caught in his throat. Was it possible? Could this figure have survived the Trials too?
        The boat crested another wave, as Trent scrambled to shelter, ducking behind a nearby rock. His instincts roared to life, the High Executioner in him screaming for caution. He watched from the shadows, his chest heaving. 
        The figure’s movements were methodical, unnervingly efficient. It leapt a small bench with fluidity, reaching for an oar and pulling it hard. The boat veered sharply, dodging a swirling eddy. It corrected course immediately, its prow aimed directly for the shoreline.
        It’s coming here. 
        Panic surged as Trent’s hand brushed the air where his scabbard should have been. His blade. It was gone. Scattered somewhere across the rocks along with the remnants of his High Executioner’s uniform. He gritted his teeth, cursing under his breath. Skies above, they’re all out in the open!
        Trent bit his lip, calculating if he could hide it all before it arrived. But then his eyes landed on a second figure navigating the rocky shoreline nearly twenty yards away. Her face was long and thin, unnaturally stretched like leather pulled taut over bone. It wasn’t just age that marked her features—it was something else. Something… wrong.
The Darkened Dawn. 
        Trent narrowed his eyes, watching as the boat collided with the rocky shore. Wood cracked and splintered as it came to rest, the landing ungraceful, almost rushed.
        The cultist stepped forward, her hand outstretched toward the figure like she was welcoming an old ally. Her movements, however, betrayed the tension in her frame. The breeze caught her cloak, pulling it back to reveal her other hand resting lightly on the hilt of a concealed knife.
The cursed figure leapt from the boat, landing with a solid crunch of pebbles beneath its feet. It straightened slowly, unnaturally, its posture rigid and commanding. In the muted light, Trent could make out more details: the stretched tunic clinging to a muscular form, its dark, charred skin marked with the same pulsating violet veins he’d seen on Sibier.
But this creature was no Sibier.
It stood a full head taller than the cultist, looming over her with a predatory presence that sent a chill racing down Trent’s spine. He couldn’t look away from its every movement—fluid, deliberate, almost inhuman.
        For once, Trent was glad he still held sway over the King’s forces. He wasn’t sure exactly what he was up against, but he had a sinking feeling that this wasn’t something a single blade could defeat.
        The monster didn’t take the outstretched hand. Instead, it turned its gaze to the cultist, the tension palpable. Its eyes, glowing faintly with a predatory light, bore into her as though weighing her very soul. Trent’s stomach turned at the intensity of the creature’s stare.
        The cultist remained still, resolute, her hand extending further in a gesture of peace. But Trent saw her fingers twitch near the hidden knife, a subtle readiness beneath her calm demeanor.
Finally, the creature took her hand. Its massive fingers engulfed hers in a grip that seemed more threatening than cordial. Trent couldn’t make out the words exchanged between them, but the creature’s voice rumbled low and gravelly, like the scrape of boulders grinding together.
Then the figure stilled, its head tilting slightly, as if catching something in the air.
Trent froze. 
The monster's eyes traced the path of Trent’s discarded items, until it finally rested on the rock that he hid behind. Trent felt as though lead filled his heart. Skies, he swore inwardly,  I’m a fool. 
        The monster’s expression darkened, its body tensing, the violet veins in its arms pulsing like coiled energy ready to explode. Then, without warning, it struck.
The cultist never saw it coming. The backhand sent her flying to the ground, her body crumpling with a dull thud.
The monster’s growl became a roar, sounding like screeching stones. Loud enough Trent could hear. </Others> “You try to persuade me to trust you but you’re not even talented enough to tell you’ve been followed.”
The cultist only grimaced in response, wiping blood from her lips.  
With an effortless leap, the creature returned to the boat. It kicked off the rocks, sending the craft gliding back into the waves. The monstrous figure stood at the stern, glaring down at the cultist one final time. </I> “When I return, I’ll require proof that the King has discovered secrets to undo us. Else, I’ll conduct the investigation myself.” Then the figure disappeared into the sea. 
For a moment, silence returned to the shore, the only sound the rhythmic crash of waves. Trent saw the cultist rise slowly, her face steady and still yet her eyes held the same emotion Icar often held: rage.
Then suddenly the cultist turned towards Trent, a knife flying from her palms. It embedded its right in the rock inches from Trent’s head. 
Heavens above. Ripping the knife out of the rock, Trent didn’t wait for the cultist to continue her attack. He sprinted across the uneven ground, his bare feet skidding on wet rocks. He didn’t look back.

Chapter Twenty[bv][bw]
</we> “All would find wealth, if they were only to open their eyes and See”
























Luckily, the seas were calm, thought Sibier, or calmer… He didn’t know if the sea could ever be peaceful. 
Thousands of feet below Sibier — and the island — stretched the boisterous ocean. The waves mirrored the queasiness in his stomach, churning and tossing. The harness stolen from the Darkened Dawn wrapped around his waist, a safety net should his fingers lose their grip on the island's slick underbelly. 
Gazing down, he saw the rocks loom like an inverted mountain, the island's tip just grazing the ocean's surface. Gnats buzzed around his head and he fruitlessly swatted at them, as his stomach rose into his chest. Closing his eyes briefly, he sought respite from the dizzying sight of the swirling sea.
Am I really about to do this? He took in a deep breath, seeing the stars in his mind. He could almost feel his parents there, connected to him by his promise to save their dream. His father had used to whisper to him about the wealth of seaweed dangling underneath the island bottom — enough to feed the entire kingdom for years, he had always said. Harvesting it had always been a dream of theirs, but they had never been desperate enough to try it. It was too suicidal… even with the equipment. 
 Exhaling, he gave a prayer to the stars. Please Father, Mother, he thought, help me do this for Ilyian. 
Opening his eyes, Sibier tugged on the rope. </The Survivor> “Do you have me?” he asked again for the hundredth time. Yorin, ever taciturn, responded only with a grunt, fueling Sibier's exasperation.
Sibier shook his head in disbelief. I’m hanging over the blasted ocean searching for seaweed, and I can’t even get the man to talk, he muttered. Heavens above. 
</I> “Terit, is the rope secure?”
</He> “No,” Terit snapped, irritated. </He> “Of course it is, kid! Skies, get to it already! We’re hungry here.”
Yorin mumbled an indecipherable agreement. 
Ok. Closing his eyes, Sibier steeled his nerves. For the final time, he checked the rope, and he noticed his knuckles were starkly white — he was clenching the rocks too tight. </this man with the High Executioner> “Alright.” He faintly whispered, praying to the stars. </He> “Let me go.”
Yorin grinned. He let go. 
Sibier’s legs slid off the edge of the island — too quick. Skies. Grimacing, Sibier slammed his leg against the first foothold he found earlier. His skin tore, as his fingers scraped against rocks. His grip was slipping. Heavens above. 
Roughly, he jammed his toes into the second foothold. Breathing hard, he tried to fix his grip. His left foot slid out.
Grunting, he pulled his leg in, planting it in a different crevice. He squinted in pain, as he desperately clung to the rocks. His heart raced in his chest, as he shivered as he saw the ocean thousands of feet below. Heavens above. 
Sibier's head spun, a dizzying reminder of the peril he willingly embraced. Clinging to the precarious crag, he allowed himself a fleeting moment of rest. Secure, yet teetering on the edge of eternity, he shuddered at the thought of repeating this harrowing act. Visions of his parents flickered in his mind, stirring a bittersweet warmth in his chest. What would they think of their son now, dangling between bravery and folly?
</He> “Sibier?” Terit called out, a hint of concern in his voice. </He> “You on?”
Unconsciously, he nodded, the sight of the turbulent ocean below igniting a nauseous dance in his stomach. Don’t look down, he willed himself, his voice a brittle mask of calm. </He> “I’m fine.”
</He> “Great,” Terit replied tersely. </I> “Hurry up then!”
Sibier bit his lip, swallowing his retort. At moments like this, he couldn’t believe he was helping these ingrates. But deep down, he knew he really wasn’t doing it for them… Skies! Focus! 
The rocks before him were a jagged tapestry of potential holds. Carefully, he navigated them, each movement a battle against the biting cold and the relentless pain.
The rocks were unforgiving, cruel in their sharpness. 
Through squinted eyes, he glimpsed his hands – a shocking canvas of blood, quivering in the icy wind, their color drained to a ghostly blue. His heart faltered, fear like ice in his veins. Even his breaths emerged as fragile clouds, dissipating into the frigid air and he could feel his very bones shaking. How much longer can I hold on? Sibier wondered. He felt tears well in his eyes. How long can I hold onto my family’s dream? 
Glancing back, the island's edge loomed ominously close, yet the seaweed – their food and their lifeline – dangled tantalizingly out of reach, swaying from the rocks in lush, green clusters.
Doubt crept in. This was more than risky; it was a dance with death itself. The others were right: this was suicide.
Shaking his head, Sibier shuddered as his leg scrapped stone. He grabbed his next handhold, squinting. He unhooked his right foot, slotting it into the next hole, ignoring the bugs scuttling onto his toes. Don’t think about them. Just don’t.
But then, a sharp sting. To the depths with those bugs!
A curse slipped from Sibier’s lips as he felt his foothold betray him, his body swinging wildly in a heart-stopping arc. His palms, raw and bleeding, screamed as they ripped against stone, but he didn’t let go. He didn’t want to trust the rope that held him: it was all that stood between him and oblivion. 
The seaweed wasn’t far.
        Their food wasn’t far.
        He could do this. Hold on! Hold on! 
        Sibier groaned, his fingers slipping. Muscles tearing, he swung his body forwards and backwards, gaining momentum. A rock blocked him from climbing to the seaweed’s stalks, but with a leap, he might be able to catch onto a stalk. Heavens above, oh heavens above! Please help me. He kicked his legs, swinging higher. He had to time this right. He had to…
Sibier let go. His stomach lurched, as he screamed, eyes wide. 
Flying across the gap, Sibier soared into the open air. Forcibly, he impacted with the fist cluster, desperately wrapping himself around the hanging stalks. Leafs battered against him, beating him like the guards from his childhood. And just like back then, he gritted his teeth and took it. Hoping. Pleading. 
Finally, the violent swaying eased. Dangling amidst the greenery, he gasped for breath.
He had made it. Against the skies, he had triumphed.
Sibier's chest swelled with relief, his eyes fluttered open, his breaths coming in ragged gasps. Disbelief mingled with triumph. He had made it. Before him, a tapestry of colors unfolded – a vivid spectrum from the lush greens of the seaweed to the iridescent blues coming from the glowstone above. The seaweed, draped like nature's own regalia, harmoniously swayed, lit by the ethereal glow of the stones. A grin broke across Sibier's face, eyes sparkling with the realization: here was a bounty that could feed the kingdom, a cornucopia hanging from the belly of their world. Thank the skies.
</I> “SIBIER!” Yorin yelled, distant yet sharp with panic, cutting through his reverie.</I> “SIBIER ARE YOU ALRIGHT?”
Laughter bubbled up within Sibier, a cocktail of relief and giddiness. Now he's worried? </I> “Yes, I’m still here,” he called back, his voice a beacon of hard-won victory.
With deliberate care, Sibier slid his father’s knife out of its scabbard. The blade, a silent testament to his heritage, caught the feverish shimmer of the glowstone highlighting the worn inscription. The words My Hope Lives On shone, and he remembered the day his father had given him it. Those words had been just as bright back then.
Clenching the pommel in his teeth, pulled another stalk of seaweed towards him. With the dream of his parents in the front of his mind, Sibier began to cut through the stalk. 
As he filled his bag with the seaweed, a sense of accomplishment settled over him. His father’s stories, once a distant dream, now intertwined with his reality. He remembered how his father would always lower his voice, whispering of the abundance of seaweed hanging below the island that few ever braved to see. Closing his eyes, he was enveloped in the warmth of the memory, hearing his father promise him of the time they would go collect it together. It was as if he could feel the crackling fire and his father's protective embrace. This seaweed, their shared secret, was now his to claim and his to share.
Yet, a chill brought him back to reality, a stark reminder that such moments of warmth were mere ghosts of the past. His heart sank.
Suddenly, the stalk he hung onto lurched, rocks crumbling above him. Sibier froze, the hair on his skin standing up and his skin prickled with fear. A slow squelching noise, a sickening snapping beat. A grotesque symphony of squelching and snapping filled the air – the roots of the seaweed, his lifeline, were giving way.
</I> “PULL ME UP!” Sibier screamed. In a frantic move, he stashed the knife into his bag and slung it over his shoulder. The rope tautened, but time was a merciless enemy. 
With a thunderous snap, the stalk surrendered to gravity.
Sibier plummeted.
In the heart-stopping freefall, he clutched the rope, his prayers a silent plea to the stars. Nausea overwhelmed him, the world a blur of spinning terror. Wind howled in his ears, a soundtrack to his potential demise. Was this how it ended?
Then, abruptly, the rope tightened. 
The jolt was brutal, wrenching his body towards the island's edge. His knuckles cracked, and pain shot through his thighs as they absorbed the impact. The sack of seaweed threatened to unbalance him. Above, Yorin and Terit strained, groaning, as they hauled Sibier to safety. He could hear the whine of the rope, its threads threatening to tear at any moment.
The rope lurched upwards, flinging Sibier to the edge of the island. Two pairs of hands grabbed his arms, pulling him up. Finally, with a last surge of strength, Sibier heaved himself onto solid ground, collapsing in a heap. His stomach rebelled, expelling its contents violently. The bag of seaweed thudded beside him, a hard-won trophy. Never. Again. His breaths came in ragged gasps. Ever.
Terit opened the bag, his eyes widening. </I> “There was this much down there?” He asked, incredulous. 
Sibier only moaned, as he retched again. 
Yorin, with his curiosity piqued, took a piece out, sniffing it. His face contorted in distaste, a clear signal of his verdict. Terit, ever the skeptic, snatched it away for his own inspection, only to recoil with a grimace. </I> "Smells as pungent as the moss," he grumbled.
Upon hearing ‘moss’, Ilyian looked up, expectant eyes wide. </I> “Mooss!” he chirped with childlike enthusiasm, his little hands clapping in delight. </Sibier> “Mooss!”
Yorin exchanged a glance with Terit, a silent conversation passing between them. Terit shrugged, so Yorin threw Ilyian some seaweed. The boy, in his unbridled innocence, rubbed it against his nose, a prelude to his adventurous taste test. Giggles bubbled from him as he shoved it into his mouth.
Terit, watching the boy with a mix of amusement and curiosity, decided to follow suit. </Sibier> “Well, if the kid can do it, why not?” he reasoned, albeit with noticeable hesitation. He nibbled at a corner, then immediately spat it out. </Sibier> “Tastes worse than it smells,” he declared, scrunching his face.
Rolling onto his side, Sibier coughed. </He> “You're supposed to cook it, dimwits.”
Struggling to his feet with a shake, Sibier leaned heavily on Yorin’s shoulder. </Selean> “You know,” he said, his voice still weak but filled with determination, </Yorin> “there’s enough of that seaweed down there... enough to feed the whole kingdom.”
Terit, his eyes wide with a mix of shock and realization, let his jaw hang open for a moment. He leaned in, lowering his voice to a hushed, almost reverent whisper. </Sibier> “You think we could be the next Darkened Dawn?”
Sibier, pausing to holster the knife at his belt, met Terit’s gaze with a steady one of his own. </Karia> “No, Terit,” he said firmly, </Karia> “we're going to be something else entirely. Something bigger.”
Those words felt true, but Sibier didn’t know exactly how. The Darkened Dawn had not only persisted for years despite the kingdom’s relentless efforts to snuff it out, but exploded with growth. In some areas, it even felt as though the syndicate ruled instead of the government, and there were rumors the guild had more resources — and food.
Terit raised his eyebrow. </Karia> “How kid?” Even though the words were mocking, he still held a piece of wonder. 
Gazing heavenwards, Sibier answered. </Karia> “This is only the start. You’ll see.”

Chapter Something
</Sibier> “If man come unto the Stars, then the Stars will Show him his weakness that he may learn humility”
























Sibier kept his head low. 
        He was in an unfamiliar part of the kingdom, but it might as well be the same streets he grew up on. The crumbling stone walls and uneven cobblestones mirrored the streets of his youth, where shadows whispered and hunger gnawed at every soul. Soldiers loomed at the ends of alleyways, their uniforms a constant reminder of the King’s tyranny. People moved like specters—silent, hurried, afraid to linger too long in one place.
Beggars hunched in the shadows, their hollowed eyes following Sibier as he passed. Their stares lingered on the bag slung over his shoulder, their desperation palpable. He felt their need like a weight pressing against his chest. He keenly knew how they felt.
        Pausing near a hunched beggar, Sibier reached into his pocket and pulled out a small scrap of cooked seaweed. The man flinched, his bony fingers curling defensively, but Sibier crouched, tossing the scrap at his feet. </Sibier> “Follow me,” he whispered, his voice sharp and low. </Sibier> “Don’t let anyone see you.”
        He didn’t wait for a response. He kept walking, quick and purposeful, but soon he heard soft footsteps behind him—faint but steady. His lips twitched into a small smile as he tugged on the sleeve that hid his curse.
        Ahead, a guard leaned lazily against a building, his eyes narrowing as Sibier drew closer. Their gazes met for a fleeting moment. Sibier forced his expression to remain neutral before slipping down an alley. The shadows swallowed him.
        Emerging from the narrow passage, Sibier stepped into a bustling plaza. Merchants manned their stands under threadbare canopies, selling what little they had. The air hummed with tension—voices sharp and restless. Two guards stood at every food stall, hands resting on their weapons, their expressions as grim as the wares they protected.
        Sibier scanned the market. Fruit stands were barely stocked, their baskets of wilted produce guarded fiercely. A throng of angry villagers crowded one stand, shouting at the merchant about the outrageous prices.
        He felt their frustration like a ripple in the air, but he couldn’t stop. He spotted Karia and Terit weaving through the crowd, their bags of seaweed slung over their shoulders. Karia looked like another wandering vagabond, her grime and bruises blending her into the masses. Terit’s usual sour scowl deepened as he edged closer to Sibier.
        No sign of Selean and Yorin yet.
        Sibier’s stomach twisted as he searched the crowd again. Then, across the marketplace, he spotted them. Selean strode confidently, Yorin trailing behind her with a sixth bag. Relief washed over Sibier, easing the tension in his shoulders. It had been far more difficult to reach this place with so much food unnoticed than he had anticipated.
        Grabbing a discarded crate, Sibier dragged it to the center of the square and climbed on top. The rough wood groaned under his weight, but he ignored it. From his elevated perch, he could see the whole plaza: the scurrying villagers, the wary guards, and the hungry stares of the beggars who had followed him.
Taking a deep breath, Sibier closed his eyes. This is it, he thought. Mom. Dad. You’d be nervous too, wouldn’t you? He wondered if they watched him from up above, proud that he had gotten so far to achieve their dream. He exhaled slowly.
He turned his focus back to the crowd, setting his bag at his feet. Stretching out his arms, Sibier forced strength into his voice. </Sibier> “Greetings, everyone!”
Everyone ignored him. 
Sibier’s pulse quickened, but he cleared his throat, raising his voice. </Karia> “Greetings, everyone! You may know my name. I am the son of David Sogni, a man whose legacy is not dead—but alive through me.”
A handful of people paused, their gazes flickering toward him. The guards, however, were no longer pretending disinterest.
Sibier licked his lips, his nerves raw. </Karia> “As a token of what I offer, I have brought you a gift.” He reached into his bag and held up a scrap of seaweed, its green sheen catching the faint light. </Selean> “Food from a source so vast that we could never exhaust it.”
Now, a crowd began to form around Sibier, their eyes narrowing with both curiosity and skepticism. A few outstretched arms trembled, and their gazes flickered with the faint hope that hunger hadn’t yet stamped out.
</Selean> “Please, take a piece,” Sibier announced, handing fragments out to the people nearest him. </Sibier> “I’m giving this all away.”
At first, the people approached cautiously, almost disbelieving. Yet it didn’t take long for the crowd to grow wild, desperate for food. </Sibier> “Please!” A woman shoved her way closer, her face gaunt and weary. </Sibier> “My husband’s fishery has run dry.”
Sibier's heart clenched. He reached out to offer her more, but she was jostled aside by a burly man with wild eyes. Others surged forward, their pleas blending into a cacophony. 
</Selean> “The kingdom tithes stole what we had left to eat days ago!”
</Selean> “Our fields are nutrient deprived. We can’t grow our food anymore!”
</Sibier> “Please, my children are starving!”
</Sibier> “Give me more!’
Sibier’s pulse quickened. The crowd swelled around him, arms grabbing and pulling. A hand clamped around his wrist, trying to yank the bag away.
“Stop!” Sibier shouted, his voice hoarse. He tugged the bag back, and the frenzy stilled slightly. Breathing heavily, he raised his free hand. </Karia> “There’s enough for everyone—if you follow me. I’ll lead you to a haven where there’s food, safety, and freedom from the kingdom’s grasp.”
Murmurs rippled through the crowd. A few faces lit up with cautious hope, but doubt lingered in amongst the entire group.
</Sibier> “Why should we believe you?” a voice demanded from the back.
Sibier’s throat tightened, but he looked to the stars, and took a deep breath. Then, he rolled down his cursed sleeve, revealing his cursed arm. Violet veins pulsed faintly against his skin. The sight was both mesmerizing and unnerving.
</Someone> “Because I’m The Survivor.”
A shocked silence fell over the crowd, their disbelief palpable. Whispers spread like wildfire. Some stared at him as though he were a divine answer, while others recoiled. Then a woman from the crowd stepped forward, her legs wobbling as she approached. She dropped to her knees, her gaze heavenward. </Karia> “The stars have not forgotten us!”
Taking a deep breath, Sibier continued, feeling shaky. Do the stars condemn me for this? Was what he said blasphemy? He wasn’t sure, but he had to press forward. </I> “I will lead you all to this…”
</Sibier> “He lies!” 
Sibier whirled around, scanning the crowd. His heart thudded in his chest. 
</Sibier> “I’ve seen this man with the High Executioner,” the voice continued. Sibier was able to pick him out: a tall, broad figure with lips too fat for his face and eyes so sunken they looked like empty coin pouches. </The Lady> “He’s a pawn of the kingdom. He wants to lead you all to the Trials!”
The crowd stirred uneasily, confusion and anger spreading like poison.
</Sibier> “I’m not with the kingdom!” Sibier shouted, his voice desperate. </The Lady> “The man is lying!”
</The Lady> “You lie! Why else would the Heavens curse you with that arm? You’re a fiend to kill us all!”
</Selean> “He’s right that this boy is trying to deceive us,” another voice called out. A wiry man pushed to the front, waving a parchment in his hand. </The Lady> “This commission from the King orders him to round up dissidents for the Trials!”
Sibier’s stomach dropped. </Selean> “What?” he gasped. His voice faltered. </Sibier> “I’ve never seen that letter—”
His words however were too late: the crowd erupted in chaos. People shoved and screamed, fear and rage mixing. Hands clawed at Sibier, pulling at his hands and limbs. Someone grabbed the corner of his bag, yanking him. 
</Sibier> “No!” Sibier cried, kicking back. Someone yanked hard on the corner of his bag, and it tore open. Seaweed scattered across the ground, trampled underfoot. </The Lady> “I’m not your enemy!”
But his voice was lost in the commotion. 
The crowd surged and pushed, a wild, unrelenting beast. Sibier’s pulse raced as he fought to stay upright. </Sibier> “Stop!” he shouted, his voice raw. </Sibier> “Listen to me!”
        But the chaos only deepened. Faces blurred into a frenzied mass. The press of bodies closed in, sweat and panic mingling into an oppressive heat. He scanned desperately for Karia, Yorin, Selean—anyone—but saw only a writhing sea of arms and desperate faces.
</The Lady> “Get back!” Kingdom guards shouted, their shields battering through the mob. </Sibier> “Return to your homes!” Swords glinted in the flickering light.
        Sibier’s heart pounded only faster.  </Sibier> “Calm down,” he cried. </Sibier> “That letter wasn’t mine! It was--” Who was its? 


A sharp tug yanked the empty bag from his grip, nearly pulling him off balance. He stumbled, his foot catching on the edge of the box.
He plunged straight into the stampede.
Sibier hit the stone hard, the breath driven from his lungs. Pain exploded in his ribs as feet trampled him. He curled into a ball, arms shielding his head. Shouts and screams tangled with the pounding of boots.
It was chaos. No, it was worse than chaos. It was failure.
Then a rough hand clamped on his soldier. </The Lady> “Get up, you urchin,” a guard barked. He hauled Sibier to his feet and shoved him toward the edge of the plaza. Sibier wheezed, clutching his side as agony lanced through his ribs.
Fifteen guards had finally dispersed the mob, their swords drawn as they wrested control back from the crowd. Terit was pinned by two guards, one wrenching a full bag of seaweed from his grip. Selean cursed and screamed at another guard with a bag of seaweed, fighting against Yorin’s restraining arms.
</The Lady> “Let me at him!” Selean growled, but Yorin shook his head. 
</Sibier> “You’ll only get yourself arrested.”
Sibier’s focus drifted from his friends, his legs shaking beneath him. A warm, metallic taste filled his mouth. Blood.
He stumbled, his vision beginning to blur. 
</Sibier> “Sibier,” Karia’s voice broke through the haze.
She appeared beside him, slipping her arm under his shoulder. With ease, she guided him to the edge of the plaza. They settled against a stone wall, and Sibier sagged heavily onto it. He blinked, trying to focus his gaze, but time seemed to keep slipping away from him.
He hadn’t noticed when Selean had come over. She knelt in front of him, her brows furrowed with concern. Her freckles and green eyes all blurred together, but he could recognize her red hair anywhere. </Moma> “Is he okay?” she asked Karia.
</Moma> “Is he ok?” she asked Karia. 
Karia nodded, inspecting Sibier like someone who’d seen too many bruised rebels. </Moma> “The head wound isn't bad,” she concluded. </Moma> “He just needs to snap out of the shock.”
Sibier winced as he pressed his hand against his throbbing head. The ringing in his ears was relentless. </I> “I’m fine,” he muttered through gritted teeth, though the world swam around him.
Selean pressed her lips together, her expression saying everything: No, you’re not fine.
Sibier clenched his eyes shut, forcing himself through the dizziness that gripped him. He drew in a steadying breath, though it trembled at the edges. </I> “No, seriously,” he said, this time with more strength. </Sibier> “I’m fine.” He fought to sound convincing. </Sibier> “Where’s Terit and Yorin?”
</They> “They went back to the hideout,” Karia answered, leaning against the plaza wall with a wary posture. Her long hair obscured her face from the guards. </They> “Terit stormed off to grab more seaweed so he wouldn’t be hungry.”
Even through the haze in his mind, Sibier caught the sharp edge in her voice. He didn’t need more proof—Karia and Terit despised one another. 
        Sibier bit his lip, ignoring the sinking feeling in his gut. Why was this so hard? Why couldn’t they just get along? Building this dream was going to take more than hope—it would take unity. And they didn’t have that. 
[bookmark]        
Selean took off Sibier’s jacket, handing it back to him. </Sibier> “Here,” she said, </Sibier> “you’re shivering.”
        Sibier blinked, hardly even noticing the goosebumps across his skin. Was it cold outside? His stomach churned inside of him, making nausea rise in his throat. He took the jacket from Selean, nodding his appreciation. </Sibier> “Thanks.”
        Together they waited there, as Sibier focused on his breathing. He noticed as Selean sat next to him, but Karia remained standing, her eyes constantly darting between guards. 
        Over time, Sibier’s thinking began to clear. And he began to realize how badly he failed. We were supposed to have recruited people. But I only started a hysteria. What did his parent’s think? Disappointment, probably, Sibier thought. 
        A terrible gloom settled into him. They had lost all their food. He had gotten injured. Skies, what if someone had died? He bit his lip, scanning the plaza. 
        Sibier turned to Selean. </Sibier> “Did anyone…” he paused, as she looked up at him with her big, green eyes. His breath hitched, as he lost track of his thoughts. He could get lost in her gaze…
        Sibier snapped out of it. </Sibier> “Did anyone die?” 
        Selean’s face softened, and she put her hand on his arm. </Sibier> “No,” she whispered. </Sibier> “Luckily the guards broke it apart quickly.”
        Sibier took in another raspy breath, and nodded. He knew first-hand how good the guards could be in disciplining. It made sense that the kingdom would also be effective at keeping the peace.
        </Sibier> “We should go,” Sibier said. </Sibier> “We’ve already been here too long.”
        Karia looked down at him at that, assessing his wounds. </Sibier> “I agree.” 
        Sibier moved to stand, but the movement left him feeling lightheaded. He dropped back to his butt, feeling embarrassed. He tried again, but this time felt Selean’s arms around him helping him up. Her hands felt… warm. Comforting.
        </Sibier> “Thanks,” Sibier muttered. 
        Selean only smiled. 
        Together, they left the plaza, and immediately the noise died from around him. Sibier hadn’t realized how loud the plaza had been. He began to relax, as his head cleared.
        They passed through the route Sibier had used to get to the plaza. As they walked by a corner, Sibier heard someone hiss. </Sibier> “You.”
        Sibier paused, turning to the voice. Selean stepped up beside him, and Karia put her hand on her sword peering into the darkness. 
        </Sibier> “Do you have any more of that green stuff?” the voice rasped. 
        As Sibier’s eyes adjusted, he could make out the lady in the shadows. Her hair was wild, streaked with grime. Moss grew on her coat, and it puffed its wretched smell every time she moved. A scar split her lip in half to her nose. Looking at her, Sibier could almost hear his father’s voice ringing in his mind </Sibier> “Everyone must be able to come. Everyone must be invited.” 
        And that meant witches in dark alleyways, Sibier thought. He stepped forward, so the lady could better see him. </Sibier> “We don’t have any more,” he said. </Sibier> “But we know how to get some.”
        The lady narrowed her eyes. </Sibier> “How?”
        </Sibier> “We’re building something,” Sibier started. </Sibier> “A safehaven of sorts. A place where we can be free from the Kingdom, and a place where we will have food.”
        The lady snorted. </Sibier> “Son, you expect me to believe that? You’re dumber than a pile of rocks.”
        The words fell out of Sibier’s mouth, and before he could think of anything to say, Selean interjected. </Sibier> “He’s serious. Believe it,” she said, her voice fiery and passionate. 
        The Lady chuckled, leaning back in her little crevice. </Sibier> “Who are you? His pet?”
        </Sibier> “I am not His pet!” Selean stomped her foot, but this only made the old woman crackle. 
        Sibier’s heart dropped at the interaction. He should just walk away now. He had offered this lady a chance. She declined. He didn’t want her in his dream anyways -- not after she insulted them so openly like that. 
        But Sibier didn’t leave. His father wouldn’t have either. This lady didn’t understand the vision. She didn’t believe it was possible. And Sibier couldn’t leave now without her getting a full chance. This could change her life. She would want him to be persistent. 
        </Sibier> “Listen,” Sibier said, </Sibier> “I know you’ve been taken advantage of before. But we’re not here to do that. We have something great, and you can be part of it.”
        The Lady sighed, turning her head to fiddle with a stone in the mud. </Sibier> “What are you trying to use me for, boy?”
        Sibier bit his lip, stomaching his frustration. </Someone> “I’m not going to use you!” He paused, reigning in his tone a little more. </Sibier> “We have a safehold from the kingdom where we are building a sanctuary. There's a need for people like you to work for food and build a community.”
        The lady raised her eyebrows. </He> “You’re ridiculous.”
        Sibier frowned. </Sibier> “Follow me and see.”
        </Sibier> “Even if your blasted sanctuary existed, I wouldn't stay. I’d turn you over the guards for reward. Leave me alone boy.”
        Sibier hesitated, then took a step back. On his way out, he turned and looked over his shoulder. </Yorin> “Maam, are you sure?”
        </Yorin> “To the depths with you!” she yelled. </Yorin> “Let me have my peace already!”
        Sibier scrambled away from her, his heart dropping in his stomach. Selean, Karia and him returned home with no one else to join their coalition. Sibier’s dream never felt further out of reach. 
        He had been trampled. He had lost all of the seaweed. He had been mocked. And he had tried to do was help.[bx]
        But heavens above, he was going to try again.
________________
Trent’s Healing[by], and Strain
Chapter[bz] ?
























Trent knew himself better[ca] than anyone. 
        That was why finding Sibier would be easy. After all, he was hunting himself.
        After his encounter with the Darkened Dawn at the cliff’s edge[cb], Trent had returned to Icar. Icar hadn’t been surprised by the interaction, but thoughtful. Fearful even. This time, when he ordered him to catch the boy, Icar made it clear that failure wasn’t and option. All of it made Trent sick to his stomach. 
        Dusting off his trenchcoat, Trent pulled down his hood. Rain pattered against his hair, as he stood silently. He didn’t want to enter. In front of him was an embarrassment for a room — he had knocked the door off himself. He remembered the passion of the father, the fear in the mother’s eyes. He remembered how clean the room used to be, now covered in moss. But the kid was stained in his memory. 
        Trent stepped through doorway 469. He knew what he was looking for: any items that might be meaningful to Sibier. He frowned, disgusted. The place appeared as though it had been gutted by scavengers, with mere scraps of clothing littering the ground. A brawl even? Any blood from the fight would have been washed away by the kingdom’s near ceaseless storms. 
        His boots echoed in the room, eerie with its haunting resonance. Punctures and dents covered the walls, likely suggesting brutality. Trent shook his head. Useless. Without being able to tell the age of the marks, he would be able to learn nothing. Continuing, he rubbed his gloved hand against the wall, its black leather leaving behind a stain. Its smudge further defiled the purity of what the room had once been. What it had once meant to the little family that had lived here. Now it was a grave, defiled and unhallowed. 
        The place was devoid of secrets. 
        Returning to the doorway, Trent took a prolonged look back. His home had been similar. A single room. Barren, without furniture. He remembered spending hours cleaning it during the week, whenever he wasn’t sneaking away to practice sword fighting. Even though it wasn’t much, it had been theirs. ‘In a world where you are not little more than nothing,’ he remembered his mom scolding him, ‘treat what you do have as though it was everything.’ This time, no tears came to his eyes. His face remained steady, the frowned permanently etched on his face. He couldn’t tell if the memory stirred any emotion in him. Could it? He didn’t care.
        Glancing away, something caught his attention. Fingerprints smudged a single wooden board in the ceiling, likely due to constant use. As though it was a compartment.
        Trent hit his stomach; it was becoming a habit, even though his wound had now healed. He could walk away right now and pretend he never saw the board, but Icar would know if he began cutting corners. Trent was the best, and anything less would be suspicious. Anything less would be a lie. And you never got away with lying to the king. Icar caught everything. Skies, to the depths with him. 
Fuming, Trent marched forwards, a plea on his lips. Pleading for whatever was in there to have been robbed. Pleading for it just to be ashes. Pleading for it to be a burnt memory. 
For once, Trent pleaded to fail. 
Reaching up, his glove pressed against the board, easily thrusting it out of the way. Squinting, Trent looked up at the small compartment, confused. Diapers[cc]? Is this some sort of cruel joke?         
Fishing around with the cloth,  Trent pulled one down, inspecting it. His brow furrowed, surprised. They were relatively new, with little tears — unlike Sibier’s clothing. For a family that struggled to keep food on the table, they sacrificed to keep those diapers. Something unused and clean would quickly be stolen, if only to be sold. 
This family cared about their toddler. Skies.
A tear dribbled down his cheek. This was the person who he was hunting: a kid who valued his brother’s diapers more than a noble prized their gems. A person who fought to bring smiles to people’s faces. A man who made the world a better place despite the world cursing him for it. Screaming, Trent punched the wall, bursting with frustration. It's not fair!
Trent dropped the diaper, falling to his knees. </Sibier> “I can’t do it anymore,” he sobbed. He buried his face in his hands, feeling guilt crush him. </Sibier> “I can't do it.
“Not any longer.”
Soaked with tears, Trent felt the familiar scabbard beneath his fingers. Miserably, he withdrew the knife, shaking with fervor. It would be quick. His death would be painless, trivial to the consuming abyss that devoured from the inside. The world would be a better place without him. 
He saw his dark hair in the reflection, his sharp features staring back at himself with a hollow gaze. If he died here, who would miss him? Surely the kingdom would cheer with his death and be a happier place without him casting about his darkness. 
He would be free: free from it all. No more pain; no more death. Only silence — joyous, calm, unheard silence. 
He watched his nose crinkled as he cried, just like his mother’s would have. His face was unearthly pale, ashen grey. He only imagined Selean’s would be the same as her sickness brought her close to death. Trent’s sickness, however, would prevail. His sickness would take his life. 
He lifted the knife, looking away. Trent couldn’t watch — he didn’t deserve to die honorably. For the last time, he glanced up through the shattered roof at the stars: so distant, so far away. Had they ever been here for him? Had the skies really ever returned his praise, ever helped him for all the times he thanked them for? He felt so sunken in his dread, that it seemed impossible. He was too far for even divinity to help him. Was there anyone he wasn’t dead to already?
The kingdom already thought that. He would only be doing them a favor.
A young girl stepped through the doorway, meeting Trent’s eyes briefly before having them dart at her feet. Dirt rusted her face, as she held her hands together, tentatively but hopeful. </Yorin> “Moma says there is no point in crying if it does not move you to do better.” She glanced up, looking at Trent quickly, and giving a sly smile. She held her hands behind her back, as she nervously shifted from foot to foot. 
Trent’s heart broke. Here he was, High Executioner, traitor and murderer, and here stood a little girl — no older than five — comforting him. He dropped the knife. All his energy seemed sucked away from him, as if drawn into a violent vortex. 
After all his years of fighting, of rallying men and thousands of inspirational speeches. After all of the accolades, of the pats on the back, and hopeful smiles. After all he had learned, after all of his praise, and all of the advice he had ever heard, it took a girl to say it. To tell him he is stupid.
For him to realize he was wrong. For him to realize he needed to forgive himself, and for him to realize he needed to get moving. 
 Guilt is not meant to stay. Sorrow is not meant to be chronic. Fear is not meant to be held. No. They are meant to be temporary, to spur growth to fix what had been broken. He need not drown in them.
        Heavens above, it was time to swim. 
        Trent stood, turning to the doorway. The girl shyly waddled towards him, giving him a childish hug. </The High Executioner> “Moma says to hug those you love.” She smiled. 
        Trent smirked, amazed by the innocence. His heart darkened momentarily, as he thought about the stars the girl would later collect. No one could avoid them. Definitely not a little girl as innocent as she. 
        Skies, he used to fight for a better future for people like her. Trent swallowed. I want to do that again. I want to do that again. That little girl didn’t deserve a life counting scars. 
        </The High Executioner> “Goodbye!” The girl said happily, playfully running out of the room. Then she burst back in a few moments later. </Terit> “By the way sir, are you hungry? There’s a man out on the streets giving free food!” She handed out a piece of dried seaweed to him.
        Shocked, Trent took the tiny bunch of seaweed from the girl. Then, she was out again.
        Frozen in place, Trent let the contagious feeling warm him. He was so close to breaking, but he had to save his family. There was something still in this world for him. He could feel it. 
        Grabbing the last of the diapers, Trent shoved them down his trench coat. Sibier would need them, and even though Trent had to bring him back to the Trials, at least he could do this one service. He could reclaim a part of who he was. 
        He strode out to find out who this person was the girl was talking about.
        It didn’t take long. He could hear the awe of the crowd the moment he stepped out of the door. As he turned down into the street, Trent saw what he never thought he would imagine. 
        A crowd -- maybe thirty hundred people -- stood gathered around a boy standing on an empty fish crate. A hush had come over him, as they stood mesmerized by Sibier.
        It was easy to tell why the crowd had gathered. Sibier stood with his sleeves rolled up fulling exposing his curse. The crowd was stunned. They hung onto each of Sibier’s words as he talked about how the stars had saved him, and how something new was coming. Something grand.
        Trent stepped closer, sticking to the shadows. The ocean breeze blew the stink of the crowd, smelling like dry fish and mildew. He eyes looked among those in the crowd, trying to read lips. </Terit> “He can’t be the messias,” one whispered. 
        And then he spotted Karia. She just infront of Sibier, pushing back the crowd. Even from where he stood, Trent could make out the sagging darness beneath her eyes, and could see the tension in her shoulders. He knew that it wasn’t the crowd giving her stress.
        Trent’s heart sank. He wanted more than anything to go to her and ask what was bothering her. Deep inside, he knew it was him. 
        Trent stepped a little closer, trying to get a better view of Karia. It was hard with the bustling of the crowd. Whispers muttered through them, but they didn’t seem excited, but doubtful.
        Trent’s eyes met Karia’s. Her face stiffened, and then she disappeared into the crowd. Skies, how am I ever going to earn her forgiveness?  He exhaled, feeling the cloth absentmindedly in his coat pocket. 
        His mind went to Icar, to his family, to Karia and then back to Icar.
        Then the High Executioner strode forward.

Chapter Something[cd] or Another
A star in the sky shine the brightest when the night is at its Darkest
        
























Trent frowned when Sibier pumped his fist into the air, letting it crackle with power. 
In response, the crowd shifted uneasily, not cheering as Trent expected Sibier to have hoped. After years of leading a rebellion, he could easily see how the crowd moved with their own mind, not following Sibier’s urges. They talked nervously amongst themselves, intrigued but not yet committed. They held scraps of seaweed, but Sibier looked like he ran out earlier than he had hoped. He was nervous, worried that he would lose control of the crowd. 
Trent’s heart went out to the kid. He had often felt the same when he first tried to grow the rebellion. His hands rubbed the diapers, trying to ignore what he was about too. 
Trent noticed how Sibier’s smile dropped into a frown as he eyes landed on him. Trent didn’t break his pace, and soon the crowd quieted as he drew close. Uncomfortable silence. 
</Terit> “Sibier! I have something for you,” Trent called, pulling out the diapers from his pocket.
Trent watched as the boy’s eyes went wild, looking for an escape. But with this crowd, Sibier couldn't run. It would condemn him as a leader. It took a few moments for him to realize this, his jaw going rigid. 
By the time responded, Trent was already passing people in the crowd. Everyone gave him a wide berth. In the past, people had mobbed the High Executioner, but the people learned quickly when suddenly the whole district started losing people to the trials. 
</Selean> “I don’t want it,” Sibier responded defiantly, lifting his chin. The crowd gasped. </Terit> “I want my family back.”
Trent’s face hardened, the lines above his eyebrows creasing. </Terit> “They’re dead.”
</Selean> “Then I’ll avenge them.”
Trent moved to the front, his eyes scanning for Karia. As the last of the crowd separated, he saw her. Her sword was drawn, his face contorted in anger and disbelief. 
Trent swallowed, and gave her a small smile. Her lips twitched, but otherwise her face betrayed no emotion. But in her eyes, Trent could see the well of emotion about to break behind her eyes. 
Breaking his gaze from hers, Trent  pushed Ilyian’s clothes at Sibier. </Selean> “These are for your brother, Sibier.”
Hesitantly, Sibier took them. The crowd backed away as he did that, many of them whispering about how this was a set up. 
Sibier kept his voice as cold as ice. </Selean> “Why are you here?”
</Sibier> “I need you to come with me,” Trent said simply, his voice free of emotion. Gently, he turned to Karia. </Selean> “Please, we don’t need a fight.”
Karia let her hair fall in front of her face, hiding her eyes. Trent knew she could no longer keep the tears from her eyes. She stood there with her head bowed, sniffling quietly. Then she sheathed her blade as if in a fit, then slipped into the crowd and disappeared. Trent’s heart fell. He yearned for the day where they could fight side by side again. 
Reluctantly, and trying to cut himself off from any emotion, Trent turned his focus back to Sibier. </Icar> “Just come with me Sibier. Please.”
Sibier straightened his shoulders. </Sibier> “I am not coming with you. I won’t let down these people like you have.”
        </Icar> “Kid,” Trent rasped, his throat dry. </Sibier> “I don’t want to do this.” With a screech of steel, he drew his own sword out of the sheath.
        Sibier drew his own weapon. </Icar> “I do,” he replied coolly. </Icar> “I do want to do this.”
        The crowd hushed at those words. Trent simply frowned, his knees bending as he fell into a battle stance. </Sibier> “You shouldn’t,” he whispered, </Sibier> “don’t fall as I did, Sibier. Never learn how to kill.”
Narrowing his eyes, Sibier stepped off his makeshift platform, his gaze wandering among those in the audience. Trent could tell exactly what the kid was thinking: he was wondering if he could get the crowd to mob him. Trent already knew that wouldn’t work. These people didn’t respect him. 
</Icar> “I hope for you to kill me here,” Trent whispered.
        Sibier stood, rolling up his sleeve as high as it would go. His arm crackled with power, and hatred seem to glaze over his eyes. Trent felt a shiver go down his spine. This kid thinks I’m a monster. Trent hit his side again, coughing blood. 
</Icar> “How naive I was,” Trent started, with soft tears rolling down his cheeks. </Icar> “Just like you are. So bold, so willing to do good, so wishing to sacrifice for others…” he paused, taking in a deep breath. </Sibier> “All good things, excellent even, but I was also a fool. Confidence, brilliance, boasting — it all comes with a cost, Sibier. It grew inside my shadow, but I was never wise enough to look back and remember. Remember who I was. Remember what I came from and remember why. Why I sacrificed. Why was I willing to do good?”
Trent readied his blade, looking at his reflection in the steel. He saw only a broken man. </She> “It's not about you. It's not about me. It's not about them.”
Come on, already. Sibier tightened his grip around the pommel. </She> “Then what is it all about, traitor?”
Trent cast his gaze upwards, his eyes lost in the stars. </She> “I don’t know,” he whispered. 
</She> “I don’t know.”
Sibier responded through gritted teeth. </Sibier> “You killed my parents for a reason you didn’t know?” 
Trent matched Sibier’s gaze. </Sibier> “I didn’t kill for no reason. It was the only way to save my family.”
</She> “TO THE DEPTHS WITH YOUR FAMILY,” Sibier screamed. He lunged, thrusting his blade at Trent. 
Trent dodged the attack, not bothering with his own sword. </Icar> “King Icar tells me your parents lasted long into the trials. With their last words they spoke of how they trusted their son to carry on their legacy.”
Sibier only growled, and slashed again. Trent skidded back. By now, the crowd surrounded them, giving them plenty of space. 
Sibier leapt forward again, but this time Trent blocked. The metal ringed in his hands as he shifted forward, swinging again. His sword clashed against Sibier’s at an awkward angle for the kid, sending him off balance. Trent followed with a punch, connecting with Sibier’s face. The kid dropped to the ground, blood dripping from his nose. 
Trent sheathed his blade, taking two heavy steps over Sibier. </Sibier> “You’re coming with me kid.”
</She> “Stop!” Someone cried out.
Trent turned around, his hand on the pommel of his sword. A vagrant pushed into the area, dirt clinging to his face. He had broad shoulders, and his chest heaved up and down like he had just left a bar fight. Despite looking like he could fight, Trent could tell in an instant that this man was clunky. 
</She> “Whats your name?” He asked. 
</She> “I’m Yorin,” the man said as thought it was something special. 
</She> “Leave Yorion,” Trent whispered dryly. </Sibier> “You don’t want to get involved.”
Yorin hesistated, his mouth opening and closing. Finally, after a pause, he finally spoke. </Sibier> “Sibier is the prophesied! You can’t take him.”
</She> “Are you going to stop me?” Besides Trent, Sibier tried to scramble to his feet. Instead, Trent planted his foot squarely against the boy’s chest, squashing his breath. 
Yorin felt around at his waist until his hands finally felt for his own sword. </Icar> “Yes.”
Trent’s eyes drooped, feeling a pain rise into his heart. Couldn’t this man tell he was asking for his execution? </Icar> “Why?” Trent asked, bothered by the heroism, trying to give the man one last chance to back down. </Icar> “Why are you forfeiting your life for his?”
This time, Yorin didn’t hesitate to give his answer. </Icar> “Because he has treated me like family.” 
Trent looked down at the boy, the words causing an unbearable heat to rise in his chest. It wasn't fair. Why did everything have to go so wrong! 
Roaring, Trent kicked Sibier. The kid reared in pain, screaming out. Then the High Executioner drew his blade, every inch of him screaming for release. The pain he felt was unbearable. He needed to be emotionless. 
Then, the High Executioner approached Yorin with nothing but cold detachment in his eyes. He came for the vagrant with slow inevitability, his sword scratching against the stone. No one in the crowd would dare help. 
Yorin stepped back warily, both palms fiercy gripping the blade he held.
Then the High Executioner attacked. He pounced, blade arcing. Yorin barely blocked, but The High Executioner barrelled forward, flying past Yorin’s defense. His shoulder connected squarely with the vagrant’s chest, sending him stumbling back and dropping his sword. 
Without another thought, the High Executioner caught the fallen weapon, and thrust it straight through vagrant’s heart. 
The man’s eyes went wide, before falling onto his back. A silent gasp echoed from his lips. 
Cries and screams rippled through the crowd, as the anxious among them began to flee. The High Executioner didn’t even pay them a second thought. He was only here for the kid. 
The High Executioner turned back towards Sibier. The boy had heavenly rose to his feet, his face flushed with fury. He had retrieved his sword. 
</Icar> “You're out of time,” the High Executioner said coolly as he approached Sibier. Then the boy charged. 
The High Executioner sidestepped Sibier’s attack, his fist ramming into Sibier’s stomach. He kicked out Sibier’s feet, sending the kid crashing back to the ground. Once again, the boy dropped his weapon. 
The High Executioner sheathed his blade, reached down, and picked up SIbier by the collar. The boy squirmed underneath his grasp, but his attacks were weak. The High Executioner drew back his fist…
</Sibier> “Trent STOP!” 
The words broke through Trent’s emotional barrier, striking him dead in the heart. Selean? 
He let go of Sibier, as his thoughts spiraled in his mind. Then he saw her: she pushed to the front of the crowd, her face pained. It felt surreal. It felt almost unnatural. 
Was this real? 
Wasn’t Icar supposed to be keeping them safe? Was she supposed to be ill? 
Pure shock washed over Trent, as he watched dumbfounded as Selean ran towards him. Then horror filled him. She must’ve seen me kill. His throat went dry. His hands shook. He couldn’t focus. 
His brain didn’t even register Sibier’s cursed fist. Yet, when the cracked skin connected with his ear, he felt its pull. Enhancing his anger. His Dread. His anguish. I failed my sister. 
Then the pain came. 
And then the darkness.

Selean Carries Trent
Chapter Twenty[cf][cg]-Four
























Sibier felt the sting in his knuckles. 
        Before him, The High Executioner dropped to the ground, motionless. 
        Sibier took a deep breath, feeling the adrenaline course through him. And he also felt something deeper… something powerful. Alive even. It burned within him, seeking vengeance for his parents. It too, urged him on, giving him strength and power. 
        Where he had hit the High Executioner, now smoldered flesh that burned an eerie, but faint purple. 
        Sibier’s hands twitch, hungering for more. Yet, nightmares of that night in the field haunted him. He held himself back, instead planting his foot on the High Executioner, and thrust his fist in the air. It crackled with power, and the crowd roared with applause. 
In seconds, Terit stood beside Sibier, his eyes gleaming with unquenchable revenge. He held Yorin’s bloodied blade in his hand, and beckoned for Sibier to get off of his prize. 
</Sibier> “Allow me,” Terit spat, barely audible over the cheering of the crowd around them. </She> “Only fair that the weapon that took Yorin will also take him.”
        Sibier swallowed, stepping aside, quivering with the suddenness of it all. He wanted to be the one to kill the High Executioner, but he knew better than to stand in the way. Nothing should interrupt the passion he saw in Terit’s eyes. Terit needed this. He needed to feel like he did something to avenge Yorin. Sibier narrowed his eyes. His parents would be avenged here too. 
Terit raised Yorin’s blade high above his head. </Icar> “To the depths with you.”
Selean grabbed Terit’s arms </Icar> “Stop!” she cried. Sibier hadn’t even noticed her arrival. </Icar> “Don’t kill him!”
Terit pushed her aside, but Selean came right back, showing him.
 </Icar> “Get out of my way girl,” Terit growed.
Selean didn’t let go of Terit, surprisingly matching his strength. She kept his sword pointed down. </Icar> “You don’t know him,” Selean panted, her eyes wide. </Sibier> “Please, don’t kill my brother!”
Sibier’s heart froze. Brother?
        Suddenly, Sibier felt the life drain out of his face. It made sense. They both had that jaw — the same steely glance. They did look alike, except for their eyes. Skies, how could I kill her brother? 
        How can I not kill her brother? Vengeance demanded it. He couldn’t sleep at nights without the High Executioner haunting him. He couldn’t let go of the anger inside of him. 
        Sibier picked up his own weapon, and the crowd cheered. Selean grew more frantic, pushing against Terit.
        Sibier held it loosely in his hands, glaring at the High Executioner. The man didn’t stir. He felt his hands shiver, his muscles go hard. He raised the blade high above his head. 
        </Sibier> “Sibier!” Selean called out. 
        Sibier closed his eyes, listening to the warring emotions inside his heart. The anger. The hatred. But he also had felt the very pain that echoed from Selean’s voice. The pain of being unable to save those you loved…
        Yelling, Sibier brought the blade down. His hands were hot. He felt the hunger inside of him. He felt the revolution inside of him. Am I going to kill again? 
        Yes? No! 
        In the last second, Sibier turned the blade.
        Then it cut skin. Bone. Flesh.
        The High Executioner’s hand dropped to the ground. 
        Selean screamed, letting go of Terit who stumbled forward. His eyes were wide. Sibier, himself stumbled back, shocked by his emotions. Everyone seemed in disbeleif that the High Executioner had actually lost his hand.
        What have I done?
        The crowd roared with applause as Selean ran to Trent, wrapping her arms around him, and then picked him up. She grunted with the effort, but managed disapeering into the crowd. She didn’t spare a look for him.
        Sibier lowered his head, his heart burning in his chest. He wacthed as Terit fell to his knees, his body crumpled over Yorin, mumbling curses. 
What have I done? 
He glanced around the crowd, who cheered. Pained, he knew what needed to happen. 
Legthartically, he sulked to the box which he used as a podium. He faked a grin, and then pumped his fist. </She> “Who will follow me?”
Once again the crowd erupted in cheers.
And with his elevated position, Sibier saw the meadows distantly. There, huddled against some stones, sobbed Karia.

Skies.[ch]
His blasted hand stung, throbbing with pain. Or, where his hand should have been.  Trent groaned, his moan hoarse and scraping his dry throat like a chisel. Where am I? Blurs of color passed by him, a gentle puffing of air above him. Footfalls. Blast it all. 
He was being carried. 
By Selean. 
His stomach twisted into knots, questions pooling in his mind. Hadn’t she been sick? Hadn’t she needed the doctors? Why was she at the abandoned rebel base? Selean jostled Trent, as he felt darkness swim into his vision. He faltered, groping for any breath. 
Skies, idiot. In his senseless passion, he had almost pushed himself to oblivion. Now, he wished he had died, yet he still clung to his life. Trent needed to protect his family.
Then why was Selean protecting him?
Curses. His hand hurt. No, not hurt. It throbbed. Ached. Stung. It screamed at him, begging him to heal, to rest. He had lost too much blood.
Selean saw his eyes flutter, as she gave him her tentative smile. 
Trent’s heart shattered.
He saw it. He wished he never did, but heavens above, he saw it. Behind Seleans’s failing grin was a well of stress. Built up like a castle, towering like a mountain and as eclipsing as storm clouds. Underneath her freckled skin, beneath her beauty and idyllic serenity, raged a battle. A battle not between right and wrong — there was no clear light and darkness — but a battle between sacrifice and honor. Of diligence or comfort. Of hope and fear. Of morals and ethics.
A battle of friends or family. 
Trent grimaced. A battle, he himself, had lost. 
He squinted his eyes, riding out the spike of pain. He had lost. Sibier had bested him. Now, he had no other choice but to return to the king and report failure. Would Icar tolerate him any more? What was he worth after losing to a kid barely becoming an adult? Fear settled in him like a rock, dragging him down to the depths.
Trent’s family would be in peril. 
He couldn’t return to the king. He couldn’t. For Sasha. For Selean. 
Selean rounded a corner, shifting Trent in her arms. Darkness threatened as he gritted his teeth, begging to remain conscious. Curse that kid. He felt his anger smolder within his chest, its heat stoked within him. 
Curse the blasted king. To the depths with that blundering idiot. Curse the blasted pain. Skies, curse everything! 
Coughing, Trent shivered in Selean’s warm, yet weakening, grasp. How long has she been carrying me? Blood still covered his clothes, spotting Selean with it too. He could see the puddles of tears stained beneath her eyes. He would kill King Icar for her sorrow. 
I swear my wretched existence on it. 
Selean stifled tears, pushing around gathering crowds of people. At first they only whispered, but their voices grew louder, gaining traces of awe. Blundering idiots! Trent wanted to go out and kill them all. Get out of her way! 
He couldn’t hear what they were saying, but he heard Selean’s broken response as she pushed through. </Icar> “The Survivor bested him. Under his lead, we will forge a new kingdom.” Her voice was soft, gentle. Shaky and uncertain. Yet, it was powerful. Bold. Commanding.
Promising.
And betraying. ‘We?’ Trent thought, his heart beating. She had passionately spoken the same way about his rebellion. About his promises to build a better life. She had replaced him. With this… this Survivor? The one the prophecies spoke of?
Trent felt his heart harden. She could only be referencing one person: Sibier.
Selean no longer beleived in Trent. Now, she believed in Sibier.
Jealousy consumed Trent.

⧫        ⧫


The[ci] pillow was soft underneath his h[cj][ck]ead. A mercy? No, he didn’t deserve it.
Blinking, Trent’s eyes fluttered open, the pain mysteriously vanished. He couldn’t feel. Skies, he couldn’t feel anything. He rubbed his eyes. Break the heavens and shatter the skies: I’m drugged. 
        Blinking, Trent only saw the stone wall infront of him, yet the steady clomping of boots echoed, feverish with its beat. Without looking, he already knew it was Icar. To the depths with him. Where was Selean?
        He remembered her gentle hands… he remembered that frightened smile… the gut wrenching feeling of betrayal… again. He bit his lip, clenching his eyes tight. She hadn’t been sick after all, had she? Sasha had lied to him. Had they all lied to him? Did my family betray me too?
        Trent clenched his teeth.
        Selean had run away. Skies, she had run away to find Sibier. To the depths with it all! How was he supposed to protect his family now? Why couldn’t they just stay in the safety he provided them! 
        Trent only grew tighter when Icar spoke. </Icar> “You failed.”
        </Icar> “Don't speak to me,” Trent growled. Two lives now hung over him like executioner’s axes — lives he could have saved. The captain and the vagrant didn’t have to die. To the depths with them them. If they hadn’t been so blasted honorable!
        He hit his side, trying to squash his emotions. Focus! Don’t feel. He hit it again. And again. And again. Again. No feeling. Breathing heavily, Trent squinted his eyes, trying desperately to ignore the guilt crawling into his mind, nibbling away at his sanity. Anything to avoid thinking that he was failing. Blast them all! 
Had the blasted vagrant been one of Selean’s friends?
Why did he have to protest! Heavens above, the vagrant didn’t even have to die. The stupid man should have slinked in with the rest of the crowd!
Deep inside Trent, another voice spoke -- The vagrant wasn’t the one who put a blade through his heart. You did that. Skies. Who was he really? The High Executioner? Or Trent? 
        Trent squinted his eyes in agony, ignoring that King Icar watched him. Deep down, he couldn’t deny the truth. He had been the one to the blame for all those deaths. It burned inside of him like a live coal from the depths.
        </Sibier> “Trent, tell me how you feel,” Icar said coldly. 
        </Icar> “Leave me alone,” Trent growled. No matter how what he did, the world seemed bent against him. He had enough. He was finished. Karia failed him. Selean failed him. He begged for the executioner’s axe. 
        King Icar stopped his pacing. </Sibier> “I can see your not committed enough to this kingdom. Maybe you would like a demonstration with your family? You betrayed my trust... is it time I betray yours?”
        At this, Trent’s blood froze. He felt paralyzed. 
        </Sibier> “Speak girl,” Icar demanded. 
        What came next froze Trent’s blood. </I> “Son.”
        Trent’s eyes shot open, flipping over in the bed. His heart raced as he saw his mother in front of him, kneeling on the ground. King Icar held her by her hair with a knife to his throat. 
        </I> “Mom?” Trent croaked. 
        She didn’t say anything more, as silent tears dripped from her eyes. 
        This time, no smile came to Icar’s face. </Sibier> “We are running out of time Trent. I need your full commitment.”
Rolling his legs over the edge of the bed, Trent tried to stand, reaching for the knife he kept in above his boots. He had let Icar puppeteer him long enough. One of them was going to die, right here, right now. Trent could wait no longer. His rage could burn no hotter. It was time he made Selean proud. Forget the consequences.
        His leg gave out underneath him.
        Swearing, Trent gritted his teeth, feeling faint pain against the suppressing drugs. He could barely think straight — he couldn’t even keep his leg straight. His knuckles whitened as he laid sprawled. He heard his mother whimper. 
        By the light of the stars, I will strangle that idiot!
        Icar sheathed the knife to his mother’s throat, an instead let her go. She dropped to her knees, quietly sniffling but trying to be strong. Icar watched slowly, almost from a distance as he stepped back, and settled into a chair. </Sibier> “I’m not going to kill her Trent.”
        Icar paused, then looked straight into Trent’s eyes. </I> “I’m not going to kill any of them.”
Squinting against the nausea, Trent took several slow steps until he reached hsi mother, and then wrapped his arms around him. Even underneath her shivering, she felt strong underneath his fingertips. 
</Selean> “Mom,” Trent breathed, his rage disapeering. </Sibier> “Are you ok.”
She sniffled, burying her head into Trent’s shoulder. Her silent tears wet his shoulder. </Sibier> “I should be aking you that, Trent. I can’t imagine what Icar has made you do…”
Trent softened his grip, his arms growing weak. </Sibier> “I don’t want to dwell on that.”
</Sibier> “I’m proud of you.”
At those words, Trent felt his heart warm, a small peace entering his heart. He hadn’t felt that… in too long. 
</Selean> “Thank you mom. I’ve made so many mistakes, but I’m trying. Trying to stay true.”
His mom only nodded. </Selean> “Son, there are terrible things coming. I know you hate the king, but…”
Trent’s heart froze. What was she saying? 
</Selean> “...but for yours to come, you have to listen to Icar.”
Trent stiffened at those words, but they felt earnest. It didn’t bring the hatred he was expecting. He glanced at the King, only to find him slumping in his chair… worn. 
Icar met his gaze. </Selean> “I didn’t ask her to say that.”
Betrayed, Trent pulled back away from his mother’s hug. </Selean> “Mom, what do you mean?” His eyes searched for any signs of duress. 
She gave her soft, sorrowful smile. It was meant to be encouraging, but only showed the immense weight she was under. </Selean> “Trent, horrible things are coming. Icar showed us. He is going to need your help.”
The words were genuine, and the sinking feeling of betrayal burdened Trents heart. </Selean> “What-- What do you mean?”
</Ilyian> “Trent,” she said firmly, but softly. </Ilyian> “If you don’t succeed here, it's not just us that will die. The whole kingdom will.” She paused, looking Trent deep into his eyes. He could’ve swore he saw deep into his eyes. 
</Sibier> “You’re going to have to forgive them for letting your brother die.”
Trent’s mouth opened, but he couldn’t think of what to say. Forgive them? That's what motivated him. He had to avenge his brother. </Sibier> “I can’t mom.” He felt a frustration grow in him. Why did she ask that of him? 
His mom’s pale blue eyes carried the understanding Trent couldn’t understand. </Selean> “Trent, its what he would want.”
Trent lowered his head, staring at the ground. His mother didn’t say anything more, but continued to warm him with her hug. He didn’t know what to feel. 
After a long moment, Icar finally spoke again. He looked aged. 
</Selean> “Trent, I need you to understand this. I won’t kill you your family if you fail again, but know your family will not survive.”
Trent took a deep breath. He would have never beleived those words, yet here he sat on the ground with his mother who was nodding. 
Icar leaned forward in his chair. </Selean> “We caught a Darkened Dawn spy today.”
Trent struggled to his feet, his mother helped him to stand. Together, they sat on the edge of his bed. </Selean> “So what?” He asked. 
</Selean> “Don’t be slow, Trent. The Darkened Dawn is looking to steal back the food we stole.” He puased, thoughtful. </Sibier> “It almost feels like the spy had wanted to be captured. Its like she wants us to know whats coming.”
Trent sat further up on the bed. </Sibier> “Can’t we just give it to the people? Why hold onto it?”
When Icar responded, Trent could see the stress in  his face. </Selean> “We can’t Trent. The tithes this year have dropped. We need that food for the tribute to buy us time to figure out the Trials. It’s the only thing keeping the Heti from destroying us.”
Trent moved to object, but his mother placed a hand on his thigh. </Selean> “Listen son,” she whispered. 
So Trent stayed silent.
</Sibier> “We’re getting close to solving the Trials. The blow to your head is telling,” Icar said. </Selean> “Your skin is scarred with power. Of course it's too trace to mean any significant, but it does mean the Trials partially worked for the boy -- his punch has left you falling in-and-out of consciousness for days.”
Trent tried to keep his feet steady. He didn’t feel any pain, but he wasn’t use to these powerful drugs. Days?
</Sibier> “We almost have what we want from the Trials,” Icar continued </Terit> “but that success is unraveling us. In just the last few days, the word of what the boy has done has spread like wildfire. The entire kingdom is in unrest, mobbings are becoming to commonplace.”
Trent swallowed, feeling dizzy. Why was he telling me this? What did my mother mean?
</The Vagrant> “We don’t have enough men to manage all of the riots. Even some of the lords are withdrawing their support, looking into these rumored promises of food and wealth from the boy. Our kingdom is falling apart.” 
</The Vagrant> “The kingdom was always falling apart,” Trent muttered, </Sibier> “With you at its head.”
At this, his mother squeezed his hand. </Terit> “Listen son,” she prodded gently again. 
Icar inspected Trent, his eyes seeming to pry him apart like they always did. </Sibier> “I don’t understand how you of all people were gifted with your talent by the stars.”
Trent gritted his teeth. But he was expecting that. Just because he had to listen to Icar, didn’t mean he liked him. With his mother there, he chose not to say anything.
</Sibier> “No matter the consequence, we must pay tribute to the Heti to buy us an extra year to solve the Trials. That brings me the dilemma Trent. Somehow, someway, we need to protect the food we have from the Darkened Dawn. And that’s why I need you.”
Icar paused, and then his face went grim. </Terit> “I can’t give you much men -- almost all of routes back to our kingdom have been destroyed or made inaccessible by the riots, making troop movement impossible. But you know better than anyone the weaknesses in this kingdom. No one can do a better job than you. Protect the food Trent.”
Trent looked down, feeling his jaw go hard. He hated helping Icar, but he couldn’t argue with him mom, and skies, Icar might be right. He had always been an effective ruler, even if he was a tyrant. 
</Terit> “How many men do I get,” Trent asked. 
Icar’s face appeared stern. </Terit> “Thirty, plus my personal gaurd.”
Thirty men to hold off the entire Darkened Dawn. Heavens above, help us all.

Never Expected
Chapter Twenty-Five
























Success.[cl]
        Selean’s return brought success. And a blasted ton of it. 
        Sibier stood in the rebel outpost, overlooking the swaying seaweed. He watched as two new venturers -- as he now called the role -- carefully crawled across the island’s underbelly. Their names were Luca and Sten. They wore gloves on their hands, and both were lanky, though Luca had a particularly squashed face. They had volunteered to be a venturer.  
Sibier faintly smiled as Sten yelped, pulling his hand back, likely pinched by a bug. He wacthed as both Luca and Sten tensed as Terit rained down curses towards them from the cliff edge. Sibier sighed, wondering if it had been the right choice to appoint Terit to be over the Venturers. He gave helpful instruction and teaching to them… but in a very unsavory way. 
Sibier smiled at the two venturers, giving them needed reassuarnce. </Sibier> “Your ok,” he said. </Rounding> “He’s like this with everyone.” They nodded, as they continued crawling, soon disapeering out of sight. 
Sibier stood there a moment longer, letting his thoughts linger. It was a pretty spot, with the sun setting bathing the seaweed in oceanic glows. It bathed the rocks with spots of yellow, almost making it appear filled with stars like the night sky. 
Do the stars me for claiming to be the Survivor? Sibier let his focus fall down to his feet. It didn’t feel right, and it left a part of him squirming. But it was too late now to go back. Over the last week, nearly a hundred people flocked to his growing community. They believed it: that the Survivor had come.
Sibier turned away from the edge, walking back through the base’s main room. It was filled with the group he began calling the Builders, tasked with cleaning and creating anything they could need. Currently, they scrubbed away at the walls and helped move things around. Some of them beleived he was the survivor.
Sibier passed them, heading for the rooms. This is what I needed to have happen, he told himself. What you did was right. 
His cursed arm seemed to hum with those thoughts. It left him unnerved. 
        Walking through the hallway, he passed Clover, currently their one and only cook. She held a large pot one of the Builders had brought him, with a wad of seaweed in the bottom. </Terit> “Pardon me, sir,”  she said. </Sibier> “I’m going to try to boil some of this to see if it could taste better.”
        Sibier smiled, but there wasn’t much feeling behind it. He should have felt elated, but something felt oddly amiss. </Sibier> “Good luck,” he said. </Sibier> “Let me know how it works.”
        </Terit> “I will,” Clover called over her shoulder, then disapeered behind a corner. 
        Sibier continued on, feeling a mix of shame and gratidude. He was still amazed by even how after just a week, most people had figured out what they could contribute to the community. It almost felt natural for people to see some need they could fulfill, then do it. It was a mess, but at least it worked. 
        And to some degree, all of it was built on a lie. 
        Sibier made it to Selean’s room. He stood outside momentarily, looking at the frayed, wooden door. There had only been a couple rooms that had doors, but Felt -- one of the newcomers -- had already decided to go about to fix that. They needed more rooms too -- Sibier had envisioned that each family to have their own private space -- and already a team of four assembled themselves together to do that. Sibier grouped all of them together as builders. 
        Sibier knocked gently. He listened as he heard Selean’s sniffling pause, and then with a faint breath, spoke. </Terit> “Who is it?”
        </Sibier> “It’s me. Sibier.”
        Once again, there was a pause. </Sibier> “Come in.”
        Sibier turned the knob, noticing that there wasn’t a lock -- maybe that was something he could ask Felt for -- and then pushed the door open. He saw Selean sitting on the floor, Ilyian on her lap. Her eyes were red, but when he walked in, she hardened her jaw, and stared up at him. 
        Sibier gave her a soft smile, then waved at his brother. Ilyian sat up straight, and giggled, putting his hand in the air as if to wave back but instead it went into his mouth. He was glad that Ilyian had taken an instant liking to Selean. It took some of the pressure off for caring for him, and he knew the companionship would be healing for Selean. 
        Closing the door, Sibier walked across the small room, sitting next to Selean. A small glowstone hung from the center of the room, glowing softly to cast shadows around them. It got cold enough here in the nights that the light would grow dark. They had a few hours before then. 
        </Terit> “Are you ok?” Sibier asked. 
        Selean remained silent, watching as Ilyian stood up and crawled into Sibier’s lap. 
        Sibier’s heart dropped in his chest. </Terit> “Do you forgive me?”
        Selean turned her head, her eyes pained. </Sibier> “I came back here, didn’t I?” She said, matter-of-factly. She paused, then looked Sibier in the eye. </Sibier> “Why did you have to cut off his hand!”
        Sibier felt himself grow weak. Selean had brought so many of the people to his community by carrying the High Executioner. Most of them were happy, or at least, not starving. Yet, Selean herself? 
        </Sibier> “He killed my family,  Selean.”
        She folded her arms. </Sibier> “So?”
        Sibier bit his lips, trying not to get frustrated. </Sibier> “I would’ve killed him if it wasn’t for you--”
        </Sibier> “Then you're no better than he is,” Selean snapped. </Terit> “Why are you here?”
        Sibier looked down, unsure of what to say. Ilyian had grown quiet. Then, he gently rested his hand on Selean’s shoulder. </Sibier> “I want to make things right between us,” he said quietly. </Sibier> “I’m hurting Selean. This doesn’t feel right.”
        </the soldier> “Then fix it.”
        Sibier scoffed. </Sibier> “Really? What do you think I’m doing?”
        Selean folded her arms, and looked directly into his eyes. </Sibier> “Your wasting what you got. Crush the Kingdom with this rebellion.”
Sibier sat there stunned. 
Selean continued. </Sibier> “I left my family to finish what my brother started. I hate him for betraying the kingdom, but he saved me the blasted fool. I owe it to him to save him now from the kingdom, and to burn it all down. He deserves vengeance. I deserve it too.”
Sibier choked, withdrawing his hand from her shoulder. Had she always had this much heat in her? </Sibier> “I… This isn’t a rebellion!”
</Sibier> “Then why did I bother spreading the word to get so many people here?” Selean stood up, beginning to pace back and forth. </Sibier> “We have everything we need. People are coming. We have Karia to lead us.”
Sibier pushed himself to his feet. </we> “This isn’t a rebellion,” he repeated, finality in his voice. </we> “Thats not what my parents would have wanted.”
</Selean> “You said you wanted to ‘make things right between us’,” Selean muttered. </Sibier> “Well this is it. Stop being such a blasted coward and free this people!”
A wall of frustration burned in Sibier. How could she think he was a coward? Didn’t he just stand down the High Executioner? Didn’t he survive the trials? 
</Sibier> “I’m not a coward,” he growled. He thought to that night with his parents when he ran. When they had attacked the Darkened Dawn. He had run then too. 
Selean looked over her shoulder. </Siber> “You are a lot like my brother.”
At this, Sibier stiffened and stormed out of the room.

⧫        ⧫


</Siber> “Sibier!”
Turning, Sibier glanced over his shoulder, watching as Terit bounded up to him. The vagrant marched in through the mouth of the cave, followed by three or four men. They carried the harness over their shoulders. 
</Selean> “This is working, Sibier,” Terit grumbled, regardless of the joyful words. The Vagrant always had a way to make everything feel like a chore. It was worse today. Sibier could feel the pain inside of the man as he talked, radiating coldness inside of him like an iceberg. It was hard to escape the chill when all that surrounded you were icy waters. 
Sibier nodded, trying to keep his face light as he climbed the ladder at the mouth of the cave, escaping to the freedom of air outside. Terit followed. 
</Sibier> “With the six of us taking shifts,” the Vagrant continued, </Sibier> “we are able to collect enough blasted seaweed for thirty people in a week in a single day. We could sustain a few more people than what we have.”
</Sibier> “Excellent,” Sibier said, looking off into the dimming sunset. He stood still in the opening, trying to regain his focus. Trying to find the person underneath all the stress, worry and guilt. He hoped he was still there somewhere. He worried the person he would find would be crushed.
Terit paused, rubbing the grime on his chin. </Sibier> “Sibier, there is something else we need to talk about.”
Those words came slow, serious. His heart stopped, the silence in the air suddenly suffocating. He isn’t going to try to convince me to go to war too? Ever since his conversation with Selean, he couldn’t get those words out of his mind. His hands had been tight since the meeting.
</Sibier> “Of course,” Sibier replied. </Sibier> “What is it?”
Instead of answering, Terit str[cm]ode away from the entrance, his shoes plodding in the mud. Sibier trailed close behind, his pulse quickening as his question remained unanswered. Silence stretched, as he wished Terit would tell him already. But Sibier swallowed his fear, trying to stop his shivering. Sometimes, the most important things to be said took time.
He needed the silence too. 
Finally, when they were far away from everyone else, Terit turned to Sibier with a wild ferocity. </Selean> “It's my fault Yorin’s dead, isn’t it.”
What! Sibier’s eyes widened, surprised. He had never been around Terit when he was like this, but surely the ruffian didn’t believe that. Trent had killed Yorin, not Terit.
Terit continued, his eyes unfocused. </Selean> “I should have been the one to pick up your fallen sword. Yorin deserved his life — I do not.”
Sibier stopped in his tracks, staring at the little man. How could anyone believe in such a preposterous idea? Trent had killed Yorion; Terit had no control over that! Sibier’s heart cinched. His belief of this lie is causing him too much unneeded grief. 
Terit threw up his hands in the air, looking at Sibier almost with a sense of hatred. </Karia> “If I had your power, I could have saved him.”
Sibier paused, his breath cacthing. Skies.  
</Selean> “Terit,” Sibier began, </Karia> “do not blame yourself for this. It is not your fault.”
Rounding on his heels, frustration flashed across Terit’s face. </Karia> “It is my fault, Sibier!” Every word fell with heavy emphasis. </Karia> “Skies, can’t you see it? Yorin was always the one carrying my weight. He was always the one urging us to do better, and always the one blasted swine that got up and tried again. There was a reason he came to your defense and I stood still. Now, he's dead. Because of my idiocracy.”
Sibier’s words were soft, as though he saw clearly for the first time in weeks. It didn’t feel like he was speaking, but like the skies were telling him what to say. </Sibier> “Do you ever wonder why Yorin always stuck with you?”
</Karia> “Because I cheated him.”
Sibier shook his head, desperate to say something to comfort him. </Karia> “It's because he saw something good within you.”
Terit scoffed. </Shem> “You’re a fool Sibier. Any reason Yorin stayed around me is because the idiot has a blasted bleeding heart. He couldn’t abandon anyone, that blasted man.”
</Shem> “No,” Sibier countered, </Shem> “it’s because deep down you hold that same goodness. You lifted him up in ways you don’t understand; out of the two of you, weren’t you always the one leading? Talking your way through the slums, cursing your way around the streets?”
</them> “Yeah, and see where that got us,” Terit threw up his hands, exasperated. </I> “All I ever did was a facade. Fake, with no real value. Skies! Anyone can talk — anyone can curse — but not everyone can be the friend Yorin was.”
</I> “Maybe it isn’t fake, Terit,” Sibier urged. </We> “Maybe what you have is just hidden from you. Maybe not even you understand who you are.”
Terit glared at Sibier. </We> “Then who does?” he challenged.
Sibier gave a faint smile, looking up to the stars. He was no longer talking to just Terit, but also to himself. Words were spilling out. Thoughts. Ideas. Beliefs he had fostered for years and was now rediscovering. 
Who he himself was.
A man of honor. 
</We> “No one truly understands,” Sibier whispered, </We> “and that's the joy of it all. Only you get to discover who you are, only you get to define what you want to be. Yorin may have seen your potential, but your destiny is yours. Look at the path you are already on: you're leading a new coalition.”
</We> “But Yorin could have done it better.”
Sibier looked directly into Terit’s eyes, seeing into the depths of the man’s soul. There, he found what Sibier imagined was inside of him too. </I> “Then make Yorin’s sacrifice worth it.”
Terit only nodded, his eyes glassy with water. Tears seemed on the verge of dripping, yet his face stayed dry. The vagrant didn’t say anything, but instead lifted his gaze. Stars began to glitter overhead.

Chapter Twenty-Six
        </I> “Whe[cn][co]n men are learned they will think that their light will outshine the Stars”


















Trent stood ready.
The High Executioner coat felt heavy around his shoulders as stood silently on a nearby tower, overlooking the storage center. The sun was setting, casting a dying glow across the castle’s courtyard. The Darkened Dawn would attack today -- that is, if they had any decent strategic mind. The payment of this tribute was this week. 
Trent kept his eyes peeled, watching several of the entry points he guessed they would take. He stationed men at each one, waiting for any of them to sound the alarm. 
The sun continued to dip below the horizon, as the sea’s gust rose. It made his cloak flutter in the wind. Behind him stood Icar’s personal guard -- five men who were some of the fiercest. 
He began to stalk back and forth, his hand on his belt. With only twenty men stationed inside of the storage center, it could be a tight defense. If this was as important to the Darkened Dawn as Icar suggested… well, Trent expected a strike force to come of nearly fifty to even a hundred. 
Trent lips narrowed. They would silently take out the kingdom’s gaurds that were stationed. Probably all across the northern wall at once. Open the gate for quick removal of the food when the gaurds were down. Swarm and overrun the place. 
The High Executioner straightened his shoulders. This was an impossible defense. But he didn’t mind this. He felt unnerved by how his mother agreed with King Icar, but if this was what his family wanted… well, then he could. 
A light flashed. 
Trent’s men snapped into action. It was the east corner. Just as expected. If he wasn’t wrong, then soon. 
Another light flashed. Then another. Then Another. Then the remaining ten men he had stationed at the north wall all flashed their lights. 
They were under attack. 




Trent raced down through the tower as two of Icar’s personal gaurd ran to spread the alarm. Trent and three of his men raced after him, moving for the courtyard. His men inside the storage center would have caught the signal, and mostly abandoning the storage center, moving to position to ambush the Darkened Dawn. If all went well, those fifteen men in ambush could drop thirty before an all out fight broke loose. 
Five other men would retain their station in the storage center if other Darkened Dawn managed to sneak through unnoticed. 
Trent burst out of the castle’s tower, his eyes blinking to adjust to the darkness now settling outside. He raced across the cobblestones, three of Icar’s men trailing behind. Leaping up on some storage boxes they had set up earlier, he clambered up on the amory’s roof -- the building just adjacent to the storage center. Panting, he crouched behind some tool boxes, overlooking the walkways. It was an ideal spot to watch the enemy’s movements, and be close enough to leap in for support when needed. He should be able to see the Darkened Dawn approaching at any second now…
Where were they? 
His men began to shift anxiously in the shadows, as Trent peeked over the walls. The lights had stopped flashing minutes ago. 
He kept his gaze focused, straining to see through the darkening shadows, expecting any moment to catch the flutter of a cloak. The darkness began to swirl, and Trent blinked his strained eyes. It all snapped back. 
No attackers. 
Trent bit his lip, watching as one of his men sprint through the streets. He kept his eyes peeled, but didn’t see anything. Had sounding the alarm scared off the Darkened Dawn? 
        Trent could only hope so. But he knew to do so would greatly underestimate his enemy. 
        The soldier reached the bottom of the armory, stepping on the windowsill and exteneding his arm. Trent reached down, and pulled him. </Karia> “Report?”
        </Karia> “A single Darkened Dawn,” he panted. Trent noticed how the man’s left armed twicthed, his clothing with a tear and bloody. He’s been poisioned. 
        Trent whirled on his feet to the men behind him. </Sibier> “You,” he said pointing. </Sibier> “Get medical equipment here now. Go!” The soldier’s eyes widened, then saluted as he took off running. 
        </Sibier> “Now you both,” he said to his remaining gaurds, </Sibier> “take this man with you and follow him! He needs an antidote immediately.”
        Trent turned his attention back to the scout. He didn’t appear feverish, but the twitching. The Depth’s kiss. A poision that was mostly asymptomatic for the first hour, then killed in the next five minutes. 
        The scout sputted, as the soldiers grabbed him. </his dad> “I can walk,” he said, shaking off their hands. I’m fine.”
        The High Executioner pulled the scout back, showing him the cut, which was now a bright pink. The scout’s eye’s widened. </his dad> “Go with them. Don’t move. Still you heart as much as you can. Maybe we can save your life.”

Lessons from[cq] Dearth
Chapter Twenty-Seven
























Ever sinc[cr]e his bout with Trent a month ago, Sibier’s community was thriving. 
        Now, there were over a hundred individuals. Each working. Each doing their part. Not one of them starved. 
        Sibier rubbed his cheek, musing. A strong positive atmosphere settled over the abandoned rebel encampment, and despite being exhausted, he didn’t regret what he was doing. He was changing lives. 
        He was fulfilling his promise to his parents.         Hearing Selean’s soft footsteps behind him, Sibier pulled down his sleeve, tucking away his curse. By now, she had warmed to him, speaking easily when he was around. Sibier would protect that trust she had given him: she deserved it. 
</the Darkened> “Swine is doing it again,” she announced as she sat down by Sibier. Hesitating only a moment, she wrapped her fingers around his. His heart swelled.
Sibier chuckled. </Sibier> “That man… is he really dancing again?”
        </Sibier> “Singing too.”
Sibier rolled his eyes, grateful for Selean’s company. She knew him well by now — every day he would sit down at the mouth of the rebel base and watch the sunset. She often joined him here, though he never told her why he waited here. It had been almost a month and a half, and he still had not heard of Werrin, Karia, Lillian or Shem. 
        And Werrin didn’t seem to be the type who didn’t collect on his half of the bargain. He should be back by now. Despite his fears, Sibier still hadn’t given up. He doubted he ever would.
        </his> “Swine by himself is bringing up the spirits of our community to new highs,” Siber muttered, respecting the man’s upbeat — if ridiculous — comradery, </his> “and he is good at all the tasks we assign him. I can’t believe he just wandered here.”
        Selean looked Sibier straight in the eye. </Iven> “I can’t believe you just wandered to find me, Sibier. Swine may be energizing the people here, but he was not the one who saved my life.”
        Sibier’s throat tightened, as he looked at her. The freckles dotting her face added to her sincerity, as she squeezed his hand. Her emerald eyes were wide, idyllic with the setting sun, adding contrasting beauty. Here is a girl who has come a long way. 
        When Sibier had ‘rescued’ her she had been broken, deflated and demoralized. Now, she fought with stunning vigor, lifted with earnest desire and saw with wisdom. At times she was still fierce or discouraged, but those times were quickly slipping away. She was recovering. 
        Sibier only wished he could recover that quick. She made it seem easy.
        Silence stretched into minutes, as Sibier’s heart beat in his chest. Being the head of a new community brought him stress, but in this little moment of respite, he felt rejuvenated. For once, Sibier liked where his life was at. Ilyian was safe. They had food. People respected him. He was helping others. 
        Right now, he had everything he had ever strived for. 
        The sun disappeared behind the towering mountain, yet the sky still glowed orange as it highlighted the underbellies of stretching clouds. The skies were truly magnificent, and Sibier couldn’t help but thank them for all the good they relinquished to him. Now, they entreated him to their unrivaled wonder. 
        Selean rested her head on Sibier’s shoulder, smiling as the sun’s light slowly began to fade. The chirping on the birds died around them, as a slight sea breeze rustled their hair. 
        Sibier wished the idyllic moment could last forever. 
        Swine popped his head out of the rebel hideout, not at all bothered by Selean and Sibier. He almost appeared like a gopher with his outlandish energy and dominating grin. How a man could ever be like Swine Sibier had no idea. 
        </Iven> “My king,” Swine began, using his ways of fancy flourish, </The Darkened Dawn> “your royal hier is being incessant with his moss pokings, and after playing with Ilyian for a momentarily hour, I must say, I’ve grown quite fond of the activity.”
        Sibier rolled his eyes. Swine was just going to be Swine. His heart was still heavy with peace.
        Ignoring the gesture, Swine continued, as energetic as ever. </Sibier> “As such, I have made three moss balls: one for the royal heir, one for you, my king, and finally one for me, of course. I must say, they are quite wonderful.” He took one out of his pocket, and squashed it. Instantly, Sibier wrinkled his nose. He had never smelled anything as putrid. He leaned forwards gagging, but doing his best to look appreciative.
        Selean laughed, as Swine tossed Sibier the poorly wrapped ball of moss. 
        Catching it, Sibier did his best not to touch it in any way. He didn’t want the stench sticking with him for the rest of the week. </The lead member> “Thank you Swine,” Sibier replied. </The lead member> “Though you don’t need to call me ‘king’. I am most certainly not.”
        </the lead> “As you wish, my lord.” With a flourish of half a bow, Swine disappeared back into the rebel hideout — leaving Sibier and Selean alone. Thank the skies. 
        Selean closed her eyes, placing her head back on Sibier’s shoulder. </the lead> “This is something I could get used to,” she hummed. 
        Sibier placed the moss ball carefully on the dirt, grateful it hadn’t squirted him with its stench when he had caught it. Peace settled in him as his muscles relaxed, listening to the faint whistle of the wind. So calm. So whole. He wished every second could be like this.
        </The other two cultists> “Me too.”
        Selean breathed on his arm, and he could feel her heart thump against him. Eerily, it held the same rhythm as when he ran The Trials, but this felt different. Yet, he wondered what Selean would do if she found out. She had seen him fight Trent, so she had to already know about it. Yet, so far, however, she hadn’t said a word. Maybe she accepted it. Or maybe she didn’t understand what it meant. Either way, Sibier kept his sleeves drawn over. It was better this way.
        Nearly fifteen minutes passed, as the darkness slowly became more complete — the sky’s colors morphing into dashing brilliance. Together, they sat, neither saying a word, just content with everything exactly how it was. 
        Sibier’s eye picked out a figure on the horizon. Chances were they were new people to join his community, but inside Sibier hoped they were somebody else. Maybe Karia or Werrin had finally returned. Just maybe.
        Selean blinked, a slow yawn coming to her lips. Still holding Sibier’s hand tight, she lifted her head, looking at the newcomer. 
        Red-brown hair that glowed in the softening light behind her. Electric blue eyes. Sharp and hardened features. Sibier knew that face: Karia had come. 
        Skies, it was her!
        Leaping to his feet, a flood of excitement and worry intertwined within Sibier as he ran towards her. He had so many questions, but at least he had one answer: she was alive. He felt a little less guilt from abandoning them during the raid of the Darkened Dawn. 
        Karia walked towards them briskly, scars and bandages covering her skin. There was no dirt or dried blood however — she must’ve had a chance to clean herself. At the very least then, Sibier knew in the last month she wasn’t scrambling for survival. 
Then why wait nearly two months before showing up? 
Karia’s face was grim as she tersely hugged Sibier. The gesture almost felt cold, as she immediately transitioned. </Sibier> “We need to talk.”
Sibier’s grin fell, as he mentally groaned. This can’t be good. She had come alone. And judging by the tension in her shoulders and the scowl, Sibier simply nodded. 
Selean trotted besides them, her green eyes wide with worry. </Sibier> “What’s wrong?” Inwardly, Sibier smiled. The girl was reaching outside of her comfort zone — she had grown a lot in the last months. 
Nodding in respect to Selean, Karia frowned. </Iven> “My name is Karia.”
</Iven> “Selean.”
Karia turned to Sibier, terse and upfront. </Sibier> “Can she be trusted?”
Sibier’s response was instantaneous. </Selean> “As sure as the sun.”
</Sibier> “Good.” Karia dug her toes into the mud, almost absentmindedly. Sibier could almost feel her thinking it was written so plainly on her face. By the light of the skies, I don’t want to hear what's next. He had a feeling it involved Werrin and Shem. She came alone. Skies. 
</Sibier> “How many men do you have here?”
Sibier raised his eyebrows in surprise. Surprised, he took a step back, and didn’t answer the question. </Sibier> “Where is Werrin?
When Karia didn’t speak, Sibier’s heart pounded faster in his chest. “Shem?”
Karia gave a quick nod. </They> “He killed them,” she whispered, the words coming out only briefly before whisked away by the wind. Nearly haunting with its teasing volume. 
Selean gasped, covering her mouth, even though she didn’t know Shem or Werrin. 
Sibier blinked, his arms dropping to his side. He had suspected as much, but he had to know. And now he did. Skies. More men had died for this cause — lives that could never be replaced. At least their sacrifice was being honored. It did not warm his chilled heart. 
The peace he had felt tonight would not be reclaimed.
</We> “Who killed them?”
Karia sniffed, fighting back tears. Despite being only twenty-two, the warrior had the loving tenacity of a mother: her compassion far exceeded what Sibier ever expected. </We> “I used to love him, you know.” She choked, stifling sobs. </Their> “I still do.”
She used to love Werrin? Shem? Momentarily, the despair inside shifted to let confusion through. Sibier furrowed his brow, still biting back tears. Werrin and Shem were dead. And it was his fault. 
How many people had died for him?
Too much... He felt as though his boots were sinking into tar, dragging him down. The sorrow clung to him, rooted him firmly in place. It took too much to step out of it: he wanted to lay down and let the sorrow envelop him. Sibier squared his jaws, tensing. He couldn’t do that. He couldn’t let anyone else die. He couldn’t lose himself to that tar. He had made a promise to his parents. He would do it. Clenching his fists, he felt his resolve harden. I would make sure of it. 
Pushing her emotions to the side, Karia steeled her voice. </Sibier> “Sibier, we have to finish what Trent and I started years ago. We have to gather our forces and revolt.”
Sibier balked. What! So much was going so well for his community right now; he wasn’t going to throw that all away! In the end, the solution didn’t come from overthrowing the government, but learning to live apart from it. So far, the kingdom ignored them, and so Sibier ignored the throne. No need in throwing away any lives. 
No one else needed to join his parent’s sacrifice. Shem’s and Werrin’s sacrifice. Skies, so many had died already.
Karia continued, sensing Sibier’s surprise. </Sibier> “We need to overthrow both the Darkened Dawn and King Icar. It is the only way for the civilians to live in peace.”
</Sibier> “No, we don’t,” Sibier rejected. </Karia> “We have all we need here,” he gestured with his arms to the rebel base. </Selean> “Why would we start a war?”
Karia’s jaw dropped. </Selean> “Are you blind! There are thousands outside of your community who are suffering. With the Darkened Dawn here, we will never be able to regulate our streets and keep people safe, let alone feed them. With King Icar sitting on the throne, every man is subject to be corrupted for wealth. Get over your stupidity Sibier!”
Selean cast her eyes to the dirt, secluding herself from the conversation as Sibier’s and Karia’s voices rose. 
</Sibier> “I won’t do it, Karia. Your rebellion has never been mine. You have been fighting for three years and all that you have accomplished is getting good people killed. Not once did your rebellion make a difference for my family.”
Briefly, Sibier’s mom and dad popped into his head. Quickly, he shoved them from his mind. He couldn’t deal with that pain. Not now. 
A wave of regret splashed across Karia, as she glanced down in shame. Her voice curled with guilt, her tone battered. </Sibier> “I know we lost that war, Sibier. I get it. Break the heavens, the people believed in us, and we destroyed their hope. In the end, we had only made things worse.”
Sibier wanted to comfort her, to tell her it was alright, but he couldn’t. He was mad — frustrated even. She didn’t come to tell him that Shem and Werrin had died, but instead requested that the people in his community give up their lives for a useless war. Requesting that his people give away their first real opportunity. She was requesting beggars to aid those who had scoffed at their need. To fight their war. That is why she came, and her audacity stung Sibier. No, he wasn’t going to comfort her. Skies, he was mad.
He kept his voice even, doing his best to ferret out all anger. </Selean> “Karia, you're welcome to stay, but there will be no war.” He left no room to question.
Turning on his heels, Sibier stalked away. 
After all, he needed to make sure Ilyian didn’t choke on the moss ball Swine had given him.

1. NEW SCENE: Trent as Emperor.
   1. Scene Progression: Talk about how his food distribution and removal and strict kingdom laws is causing increased riots, and great unrest. Groups question Trent’s authority and ability to protect them from the DD, the most influential one led by Karia’s Father -- which is preventing the success of Trent’s reforms. Trent heads to the riot, and publicly executes her father (also in an act of revenge).
   2. Goal:  Show the stress on Trent, and highlight how he feels stuck and desperately wanting Karia by her side. Also highlight the growing tension in the kingdom

Empty Horizons
Chapter Twenty[cs]-Nine
























Ilyian snorted. 
        Sibier gave a restless chuckle, as his four year old brother lay asleep on his lap. Tonight, he slept under the stars. Glittering in the sky, they lit the blackest night with hope. 
        After all, only in the darkness do stars shine the brightest. 
        A warm gust settled over them, the dirt soft underneath their weight. Ilyian nuzzled his chin to Sibier’s chest. It had been this way before his parents had been taken — then, they slept as a family underneath the stars. Now, his parents watched from amongst them. 
        And they beamed with pride. At least, that’s what he chose to believe. He was accomplishing their dream. Skies, he was actually doing it. 
        Ilyian squirmed, placing his drooling mouth straight on Sibier’s arm. Pushing Ily’s head gently to the side, Sibier cast wet eyes to the sky. I wish they could be here. Now, once things are finally going right. When things are finally working out for them. With every passing day, the community swelled with growth. Terit had discovered a way to strip the seaweed of impurities, coating the moss with seeds they had discovered on the island’s underbelly. Surprisingly, the seaweed tasted delicious after the treatment, and the leftover gunk from the plant proved effective as a soap. Further, it was Swine who discovered that this gunk — when mixed with a little wax  —  made better candles, their flames more resilient to brisk winds or rain. Secrets learned in only a few days.
        Both were miracles granted to them from the stars. Maybe one came from pa, and the other from ma. Sibier smiled, content. Yes, that is it. 
        Seaweed was turning out to be quite the commodity. A few months ago it was discarded as useless — now it is a lifepreserving plant. Sometimes, Sibier wondered if he was like the seaweed: maybe he wasn’t understanding his full purpose. Maybe there was more to him than he thought.
        What could he discover now? What could he find in what he would’ve discarded before? Skies, he felt that there was more. He felt it in his bones, in his blood, in the way the purple elixir flowed through his veins. 
There was more he should be doing. He felt it. He knew it. Sure, he was giving the hundreds in his community a new life, but what about the millions in the kingdom? Thousands probably still suffered. Thousands that could still be helped. They were out there, and Sibier couldn’t help but think that they were waiting. Waiting for him to discover that new secret.
What was it? What could he possibly do?
        Glancing up at the stars, Sibier felt a tear roll down his cheeks. </Karia> “Is there more?” he whispered, his heart pounding in his chest. </Karia> “What is there that I need to do?”
        The night was silent. The stars glittered peacefully overhead, far away and distant. Ever serene with the comforting chirping of nearby insects.
        Then a star streaked past the cluster of moons. Sibier’s eyes followed it as it traced the heavens, his mouth hanging open: it was beautiful. But what did that mean? Was that a yes? 
        Sibier blinked, trying to understand. </Sibier> “Teach me,” he begged, voice soft. </Terit> “What am I to do?”
        Above, the stars only twinkled. Silent. They had nothing more to say, nothing more to teach. Did he miss it? Was there really nothing more?
        </Sibier> “Sometimes, Sibier,” his dad once chided him, </Terit> “the skies expect us to place faith in them. Often their silence allows us to learn the most about us. Act. Do.”
        But what? What was he expected to do? How was he expected to act? He felt like he should be doing more, but how could he leave this community he began? What more could he do?
        Then he remembered Karia’s plea. War.
        Break the heavens, Sibier cursed, I’m an idiot. The skies already knew that he knew what he had to do. Skies, he felt it ever since Karia had come back. But he had been too stubborn to realize. Even now, he didn’t want to admit it. But he knew. He swallowed. Skies, he knew.
        His heart burned, as he turned his gaze upwards. </Terit> “Thank you.” 
        The words caught on the gentle breeze, carried out of sight. The stars watched him, and he knew they heard his words. Sighing, Sibier rested his head on the dirt, keeping Ilyian close. He knew what to do. 
        The hundred lives in his community was not enough. 
        It was time to make a difference to all of them. 
        Everyone. 
        It was time to make a difference to everyone.
        A faint smile tugged on the corners of his lips as he stared blankly, growing on his face. Slowly it drew into a grin, outrageous and boisterous. And his. Peace settled in his stomach, a resolve coating his feelings. Yes, this is what I am going to do. His hair bristled with excitement. This was his cause, this was his purpose. It had been carved out for him by the sky. 
        And he would do it. 
        Feet plodded in the dirt besides him. Turning on his side, Sibier found Swine draggin the harness equipment across the dirt. 
        Sibier’s mouth opened to say something, until he caught four Darkened Dawn approaching Swine. Curses! By the look of it, the Darkened Dawn had already spotted Swine… he had to do something. Quickly, he narrowed his eyes, looking for a rock for a distraction, but it was too dark. Heavens above! 
        One of the Darkened spoke. </Terit> “Finally about time you got to it. We were beginning to wonder if you couldn’t figure out a way to cripple them.”
        Swine bit his lip, nodding. </Sibier> “Yes, this is the equipment they stole from us.”
        Us? Sibier’s hands froze as his pulse stopped. What was going on here? Hiding Ilyian in some shrubs, Sibier felt for his knife. He wasn’t going to lose that equipment today. 
        Continuing, Swine hesitantly held up the harness. </Sibier> “Without these, the society will crumble. They are dependent on the seaweed.”
        A Darkened Dawn cultist reached out, his gloved hand encircling the equipment. </Sibier> “Iven,” he started, </Terit> “you are sure that we need not to kill the kid? Roc thirsts to make this as painful as possible.”
        Sibier hunched on his knees, but he felt weak. He couldn’t move, as he felt betrayal caked in his mouth. He bit back his tears… what was going on?
        Iven — Swine? — gulped. </Sibier> “Yes, Sibier is to be left alone.” Iven’s voice cracked as he said the next words, struggling to keep back tears. </Sibier> “The betrayal will be much more painful to them than his death. It is not necessary.”
        The Darkened Dawn held Swine’s gaze, before slowly nodding. </Sibier> “Then just the equipment will be necessary. Well done, Iven.”
        Sibier scrambled away from Ilyian, keeping low to the splotchy grass, panting. Shivering in the cold, he rolled up both sleeves, rubbing the knife’s steel against his cursed arm. It took in some of the iron’s durability, becoming hard and glistening in the moonlight. He took in a deep breath, doing his best to stomach the pain. 
        Courage. Skies, he needed courage right now.
        He closed his eyes, his lips quivering as he whispered a prayer. Please, he begged. Help me. He took in another breath. Please. 
Sibier stood. </Sibier> “Wait!”
Five pairs of eyes turned on him. Swine cursed under his breath. 
Sibier’s skin rolled up, but he squared his shoulders. Always face them. Look your enemies in their eyes, his father’s words echoed. Valiantly, if not foolishly, Sibier forced out his next words over nervous tension. His father taught him well. Thank the skies.
</The Darkened Dawn> “That equipment belongs to me.”
The lead member turned to Iven, voice level. </Sibier> “Is this klutz Sibier?”
Swine only nodded, his face emotionless  — dry, unlike the person he had grown to know. Sibier couldn’t tell if shame lit the red behind his cheeks or embarrassment at being caught. 
</Sibier> “Break him then,” the lead ordered, </Sibier> “but don’t kill him. Let's make this as painful as possible like Roc suggested.”
Sibier twitched, his grip around his knife tightening. Above, he could almost hear the anxiety of the stars, watching with their glittering light. Now, he was doing something more. He was waging war with the Darkened Dawn. 
Just like the skies had wanted. 
Heavens above, they better help him here. His heart pounded in his chest.
Taunt, Iven held the harness, as the other four withdrew their swords. It took everything Sibier had not to run, but to stand there and wait. A knife against four men with swords? He shivered, but did not flee. Waiting.
What am I doing? I am no swordsman! Sibier clenched his teeth, casting one more wary gaze skywards. Break the Heavens, if this isn’t faith, I don’t know what is. He held firm. 
A cultist swung his sword. Sibier ducked, the blade swishing overhead. Blood pumped through his chest, tight energy building in him. Dashing forwards, he cut the man’s leg, drawing blood. A hasty, rash attack, but hey, he was still alive. 
Puffing, Sibier stepped back, momentarily disengaged. That wasn’t so hard, was it? He coughed, his muscles weak. He didn’t want to face the truth. 
Two more lunged at him, as Sibier retreated, looking for any opportunity. A sword cut through air to his right. A jab streaked to his left. Another just missing. Panting, he dodged to the side, striking. 
His opponent deflected the blow, throwing a punch. It hit Sibier’s arm. 
His left arm. 
Knuckles popped as the man yelped, squinting in pain. Dropping the sword, the man held his palm in shock, feeling as though he had just punched steel. 
Thank the skies. 
He was still alive. Phew.
Pouncing, he attacked, his fist slamming into the man’s cheek. Bones cracked, as the Darkened Dawn member dropped to the ground. In a swift dive, Sibier picked up the fallen blade. 
Now three swords against one. 
A little bit of his fear died away, replaced by burning exhilaration. He wiped sweat off of his brow. Maybe he could do this after all. This is what the skys had wanted. This is what he was destined for. This was something more. 
Sibier lept into battle, sword arcing. He slammed it against the attackers, whirling it around as it was blocked. A sword struck to his left, and he deflected it with his arm, skirting the blade. He had an advantage. 
The man’s jaw dropped after being thwarted. </Sibier> “Shatter the skies — they are with him.”
The other two cultists grimaced, one still nursing the cut in his leg. Swine continued to remain aloof, harness in hand, merely watching with sunken eyes.
Energized, Sibier leapt again, plowing forwards. He thrust at his opponents, quickly withdrawing for another attack. Carrying momentum, he grinned as he fought, never feeling so alive in his life. This was him. This was passion. 
Skies, this felt good.
A cultist slammed his knee into Sibier’s stomach. Roughly, a punch followed. 
In the time of a snap, Siber’s elation deflated. His sword fell from his fingers as he gasped for breath, tripping in the weeds.  
A sharp kick. A fierce punch. His vision blurred. 
Gasping, Sibier seized up, cradling himself. Another kick. And another. And another. 
Coughing blood,  he wrapped his arms around his head. I’m dead. A sword ripped through grass nearby. Images blurred by his face as he screamed, beaten and broken. Skies, I had tried! Where are you? 
He didn’t have much time left.
Gritting his teeth, he pushed himself to his knees. Stand, you fool! Get up! He had to — else he was dead. Get up! Forcibly, he planted an arm beneath him, shaking as he held himself. He could not lose this battle. He glared at Swine.
A boot blasted his nose. Blood popped, gurgling like a fountain. He hit the ground, dazed as his head swam. The stars went dark above him. Everything went dark. His breath caught in his throat. He couldn’t breathe. Panic. 
The moment was short lived.[ct]
        Gasping, light surged back into his vision —  his head pounding. Sibier screamed: his cry of help stuck in his throat, voiceless. Even in his dying moments, the skies had taken away his ability to plead for help. He had tried, had he not? He had faith that the heavens would help him, so why hadn’t they?
The Darkened Dawn laughed around him, their words molding into indecipherable sludge. He only felt the pain of his raw throat and broken nose. He could only feel agony. He could only see anguish. He could only taste the abandonment of the stars. He could only hear silence. 
And the whistle of steel. 
And the sickening squelch of a blade tearing through flesh.
And the cry of a man dying.
With a thump, a Darkened Dawn member dropped dead next to Sibier. 
Groping for air, Sibier squinted, trying to see through the blood covering his eyes. Light blurred in his vision, as his head rang with cloudy pain, but one figure was clear: Swine. 
Thank the skies. 
Sparks showered over Sibier as steel clashed above him. His head felt dull, colors fading as he watched Swine fought. His Darkened Dawn cloak swirled around him as he leapt over his second victim, lunging at the last opponent. 
Their blades clashed. Sibier closed his eyes, focusing on breathing. In… out… Coughing, blood poured out on his lips. In… 
Curses rang out from the sword fight, all useless to Sibier. Meaningless compared to the pain thrumming in his ears. Come on! He growled to himself. He had to get up. It's what his father would do.
Gritting his teeth, Sibier swallowed blood. Skies! Get slithering up! Trembling, he lifted his head, fighting the wave of nausea. His head felt stuffed with nails, banging around and cutting him with every movement, heavy and sharp. 
His knees wavered. His arms wobbled. Colors spun around him in an indistinguishable heap of blurs, and his resolve threatened to shatter underneath the overbearing agony. But, break the heavens, he wasn’t dead yet. Curses, I have a fight to win. A kingdom to save. 
A promise to keep.
Roaring, Sibier stood, blade in hand. He was ready. 
Swine knocked the sword out of the Darkened Dawn’s hand, following swiftly with a kick. A second later, his sword pierced the man’s heart. 
Sibier stood, teetering as he fought to keep his balance. Swine huffed, his shoulders falling up and down as he held his back to him. Quickly, he ripped his blade free, coated in blood. Slowly, he lowered his head.
        Swine dropped his weapon in the mud, not turning to look at him. </Sibier> “I’m sorry, Sibier. I respected you.”
        Sibier stepped forwards, but slipped, falling to his knees. Darkness crept into the sides of his vision, threatening to overtake him. Threatening to consume. Yet, he couldn’t give in. This man, Swine, Iven?  — Sibier didn’t care  — was a[cu] traitor. An enemy. Sibier couldn’t let him get away. </Roc> “Come back and fight me!” he yelled. It came out raspy, barely audible. 
        Iven didn’t look back. He picked up the harness in his hand, slinging them over his shoulders as he marched away. Slowly and painfully. </Sibier> “Sibier,” he whispered, </Sibier> “I left you alive. It is the only mercy I can give.”
        </He> “Coward!” Sibier screamed, crushing dirt between his fingers. It took everything he had to not fall over. Heat burned in Sibier’s chest. Swine may have saved his life, but the cursed idiot had doomed so many others. Without those harnesses, his entire community would be forced to return to the streets. Begging for scraps.
        Suicide. 
        Resolve flared within him. Karia is going to get her war alright. Against the Darkened Dawn. 
        Against Iven. 
        Shatter the skies, to death with that man. After all, he really was a swine.

Cold like[cv] Death
Chapter Thirty
























Seven days. 
Already they were nearly out of seaweed. It had only taken seven days. 
        Sibier groaned. Strapping a belt around his waist, he sheathed his sword. Eighty soldiers gathered in front of him, their lips tight. There was no laughter, and barely any comradery. They all felt the looming hopelessness hanging over them like an executioner’s axe. 
Sibier lifted his chin, defiant. His broken nose was still obvious, accompanied by a little whistle whenever he breathed. At least his people knew that he hadn’t lost the harnesses without a fight. 
        Selean gently touched his arm. </Sibier> “It's time,” she whispered. Sibier swallowed, his eyes lingering over her. Somehow, she had managed to find a sword of her own, her fingers nervously rubbing the top of its hilt. Her wide eyes shone with fear — and hope. 
        That is what we are fighting for, Sibier realized. For hope.
        That was what they were starting a war for. He felt the anxiety rocking back and forth in him, never settling in him. Skies, he was starting a war. His throat felt dry.
        Looking over his other shoulder, he met Karia’s hardened features, as she gave him a curt nod. This might be the last moment any of them had of peace. Better make it count. 
        Climbing onto a nearby rock, Sibier cleared his throat, the people quieting their nervous chatter. They already knew what he was going to say. Everyone did. But they wanted to hear it from him.
</Sibier> “We know what it feels like to be cast out,” Sibier began, his words coasting over his audience, almost shaky as he trembled. Skies, he practiced this! </Sibier> “We know what it feels like to be trodden under other’s feet. We have tasted their heels, and we have tasted dirt. They have given us no chance. And when we create our own opportunities, they take them away. 
        “So what are we worth? To them, we are simply objects to be lost in the sea. Vagrants, vagabonds, wanderers, derelicts. Urchins. But they don’t know you. All they know is how to treat us like trash, and in that regard, we are worthless.
        “We are worthless at being trash.”
        Sibier paused, looking straight into Selean’s eyes. There was a girl who had been discarded, and whoever had thrown her away had lost a valuable jewel. They never saw how much more she had.
        </Sibier> “Brothers, we are so much more! Today we prove that to the kingdom; today we show them what we truly are!
        “Today, we aren’t trash. Today, we are not forlorn, no. No!” Sibier screamed, pumping his fist. </He> “We are those who will take back what is ours. We are those who will earn our respect, we are those who will defend our happiness, and we are those who never surrender. We are courageous! We are valiant! And we are together! Not abandoned, not alone, and never lost. We can become something more. And today, we will show it to them.”
        The crowd cheered, voices lifting high into the sky. Many of them had spent years rotting on the streets, waiting for an opportunity like this: to strike back, to make something out of their lives. And now Sibier offered it to them. But in the back of his mind, he still felt it. The foreboding anxiety — the fear that they would lose everything. Wars came with a heavy cost, and Sibier doubted he had enough to pay it. But as he looked back into the crowd — seeing the fearful men, the quivering vagrants and broken warriors all standing together, tall and defiant —  Sibier felt his confidence surge. Maybe they did have enough. 
        He rolled back both sleeves, revealing his curse. A gasp snaked through the crowd, shock rolling up their faces. They weren’t expecting this. 
        </Skies> “We survived their cruelty. We survived their beatings, their laughter, their mockery.” Sibier grew quiet, almost deadly with reminiscence. </Siber> “And we survived The Trials.
        “Because of them, we are stronger. We have what we need to beat them in battle. And,” Sibier lifted his arm high in the air, his purple veins glowing with mystical heat, </Sibier> “we have magic!”
        Their cheer was deafening. 
It was about time the skies favored them.

⧫        ⧫


With an army behind him, Sibier tore away the wall that led into the Darkened Dawn’s vault.
It was time for war.
His arm stung holding the durability of the stone, as he tried to shake off the feeling. Slowly, it dissipated as he clenched his eyes close, riding through the pain. He was getting better at controlling his magic. He smiled: they would need it tonight. 
</Sibier> “Lead the way,” he gestured for Karia. She nodded to him, her jaw tense. Luckily for us, at least she knows what she is doing. Inside, Sibier couldn’t shake out the dread inside of him. People were going to die. And it had been his choice.
But there was no other way to get the food they needed. If his community was going to survive, they needed to raid the Darkened Dawn’s vault. They needed war. 
Swallowing his fear, he followed Karia into the building, once again shielding his eyes to the blinding amounts of glowstone. Those hoarders, he thought with distaste. There was no way they were going to complete this mission in the dark — with a party of nearly eighty, they were bound to be discovered. 
A group of five or so broke off, shoving some glowstone in the bag. Sibier took in a slow breath. There was no use in only stealing food when they could take so much more. His eyes darted down the hallways, nervous. Anxious.
Skies! This better work. If he had misinterpreted the star's intent… Sibier almost wished they would be discovered. Then, he wouldn’t have to wonder, waiting for the inevitable. He felt ready to tear off his skin. His heart beat in his chest louder than a blasted drum.
Karia rounded a corner, Sibier trailing close behind. Every noise sent shivers down his spine, his anxiety only growing into a bigger cloud, a shadow darkening all his thoughts. He could barely bear the tension on his shoulders, his sword impossibly heavy at his waist. 
Luckily, they had almost made it to the food storage. It was merely across the hall from where they entered — Karia was well prepared. They would need every advantage they could get. You could not take waging war against the Darkened Dawn lightly. 
Cautiously, Karia opened the d[cw]oor. 
Guards. 
Sibier’s pulse quickened as an assailant lunged, his sword arcing. Karia ducked out of the way, her hair flying as she counterattacked, leaving a sword in the man’s stomach. 
</Idiot> “Intruders!” One of the Darkened Dawn yelled. The rest readied their swords, planning to impale anyone who stepped through the doorway. Sibier swallowed, his purple veins popping with nervous tension. Open up the bottleneck, he remembered. They had rehearsed this… but skies, he was stressed. Open up the bottleneck.
Besides him, Selean held her sword in shaking hands, looking up to Sibier. He noticed her jittering, and opened his mouth to say something encouraging, but his words were sealed in his mouth. Truth was he was nervous too. 
But there was no going back now. 
Metal screeched as Karia tested them, allowing Sibier to approach the wall. He pressed his charred fingers against the stone, closing his eyes. He felt the pulse of the elixir against rock, the steady rhythm echoing through his mind. He focused on it, letting it drown out his dread. This time, it only took a second. 
Draining the color from the wall, Sibier squinted in pain, his arm becoming immensely heavy. A guttural cry rent his lips as he fell to the ground, transferring the wall’s durability to the ground. He took two greedy breaths of air, squinting the tears out of his eyes. 
Heavens above, I'm never going to get used to that. 
Hesitantly, he placed his hand against the wall again, this time several feet to the right. He gulped — ready to suffer the pain once more. Karia had made it clear: breaking through a large section of the wall at once would give them a massive surprise… and advantage. 
And with the alarm already sounded, Sibier had no time to dally. 
Selean placed her hand on his shoulder. </I> “You got this,” she whispered. He could hear the voice waver, and yet, here she stood supporting him. Shatter the skies. Bless her. 
Pressing his palm flat, he stole the wall’s durability. The pain broke his breath as he collapsed to the floor, releasing the hardness into the ground. He bit his lip, as he pushed himself to his feet, coughing. More of the wall hung like. Skies, he was tired. His body felt as though it had been filled with lead, his energy drained from him. He was exhausted. But he couldn’t wait. He didn’t know how long the effect lasted; he had to hurry. 
The men were already prepared. They lined up behind him, ready to charge through as soon as they stepped away. The trap was nearly there. Almost done. Only one more. 
Clenching his fist, Sibier steeled his nerves. He placed his palm against the wall, steeling himself. After this, mayhem will break loose. There was no turning back now. I had chosen to follow the stars. He had to follow through. It was his promise. He wouldn’t fail his parents now. 
Breathing in, Sibier squared his shoulders. 
Pain flared. Tears sprang from his eyes as he dropped to the floor, quickly releasing the durability he had taken into the stone below. And like that, the pain was gone. Yet, he still clutched his chest, the echoes of the agony reverberating through him. Never before had he done so much in so little time. He felt as though he had been pulled apart and strung back together. Heavens above, his arm throbbed. 
Groaning, he crawled out of the way — Selean nearly dragging him. Clambering to his feet, Sibier grit his teeth, stomaching away the pain. It was fading quickly, as he watched thirty men jump into the wall. 
They tore through it like an arrow piercing a bubble. 
The Darkened Dawn was not ready for their wall to collapse to a surge of thirty men. Several of their rank fell dead before they even faced the right direction. 
This is it, Sibier realized, we’re doing it. Shouts filled the air as blood splashed to the ground, his army flooding through the hole. Desperate to regather themselves, the Darkened Dawn’s defense disintegrated, unable to muster any sort of line. They were getting slaughtered.  
Staying back with Selean, Sibier felt his heart hammer in his chest. Everything was going according to their plan. It was working. Thank you, he muttered to the skies. Hopefully, their luck would last. 
It all depended on when the Darkened Dawn’s reinforcements came — and how many they brought with them. Sibier shivered; he was the watchout, and he would be the first to know. 
And the first to fend them off. 
He only wished that they would be out of here before they arrived. That was the plan anyways. Their army could not withstand the full force of the Darkened Dawn’s militia, but they could get out before they arrived. Hopefully. 
Glancing over his shoulder, Sibier heard the sword fight quiet. All fifteen guards lay dead, with only two of their own injured. So far, not one of his men had died. He pleaded to the heavens that it could stay that way. But every second they were here decreased those chances.
Karia’s voice echoed out into the hallway as she ordered the men, as they took bags off their back. Within moments, they began shoving grain and fish into them. Some of them even managed to find seeds. 
Sibier blinked, reluctant to accept the rising victory growing in his stomach. This can still end badly, he reminded himself. Yet, it felt good making it so far. He let hope catch root in him, and it spread like a weed — difficult to uproot. 
Sibier peeked back at the progress. Most of them had their bags full, helping others to fill theirs. Soon, they would be able to leave. Yes, come on! Sibier tapped his foot impatiently. He still saw no signs of any reinforcements. Maybe they had never heard the cry for help. Maybe they weren’t coming. 
Skies, that would be a miracle. 
Selean nudged his arm, her voice a hoarse whisper compared to the commotion behind them. </the same voice> “Are you ready to die?” Her words hovered in the air, sticky with sincerity. She was scared. He could almost feel her shivering next to him.
Once again, Sibier felt as though his insides collapsed with the pressure of the situation. At any moment could an army barge in on them. 
</Karia> “No,” Sibier replied softly. </Karia> “Not anymore.”
Selean only nodded, her eyes staring straight forwards. Her whole body was rigid, taking small puffs of breath. Barely breathing. Break the heavens, she is frightened! Sibier couldn’t blame her, feeling that same suffocating anxiety. Yet, hope intertwined with it, as Siber tightened his grip around his sword. We can do this. 
He had hope that they would make it. He had to hope that his community would survive, and hope that they would prosper. Hope that tomorrow would come and go. And with that hope, Sibier steeled himself. 
</Karia> “Selean, today is not the day you die.”
She didn’t say anything, as she continued to stare forwards. Sibier only wished she had taken comfort in his words. Maybe she did, but with so much pressure on their shoulders… Sibier wasn’t sure any relief could make much of a difference. Either the Darkened Dawn’s reinforcements came, or they didn’t. 
Either they lost everything, or they didn’t.
Skies, I hate waiting. The nerves, the anxiety, the pressure. He almost wished that they would come already. Almost.
Karia’s footsteps fell behind him, almost causing Sibier to jump. Tersely, she handed him a bag of food. </Solemnly> “Apricots,” she nodded. </Sibier> “We’re ready, let’s go.”
Sibier took the bag, taking one last look at the door — no Darkened Dawn. He turned to Karia, his cloud of fear dissipating from him as rays of success shone through. A grin grew on his face.
</Sibier> “Absolutely.”
They had done it.

End of Shadows
Chapter Thirty-One






We can maybe do something here about Trent hearing the report of the Darkened Dawn raid, and getting info that the Darkened Dawn are moving at large and have Trent prepare his men. 
⧫
⧫        ⧫


Shadows snaked along Trent’s skin as he crept between blades of grass, his eyes narrowed. At the edge of a neighboring island his army waited for his signal. After hours of planning, his force of three thousand was well positioned. 
Tonight, the Darkened Dawn would never rise again. Only their ash would blow in the sea’s gales, dusted to oblivion. 
Like a hawk, Trent watched their even footfalls plod against the dirt, the wind whipping his hair. He listened to their breathing. He could even smell their sweat.
The Darkened Dawn were oblivious. Idiots.

Will Not Falter
Chapter Thirty-Two[cx]
























        The scream shattered the silence. 
        Skies! Sibier’s eyes snapped open. His eyes darted to Ilyian, checking on him quickly, his heart pounding in his chest. The scream dropped cold, sifting into the darkness. 
        The yell had come from the watchmen…
        Sibier gulped, grabbing his sword. This is why you don’t steal food from a syndicate. But, skies, that choice had already been made. He closed his eyes, taking in a deep breath but feeling like he was suffocating. His fingers fidgeting with the buttons on his shirt, pulling it tighter, listening. 
        It wasn’t long before more yells confirmed his worst fears: the Darkened Dawn had come. Break the Heavens. He had to go now. His eyes flickered back to Sibier, as he hesitated, feeling the time slip past him. Would he be safe here? 
        Skies, he wished Selean was around. His sleeping brother with his thumb in his mouth seemed so peaceful… Sibier closed his eyes, mumbling a silent prayer to the heavens. Hopefully, he wouldn’t be found here.
        Scrambling, Sibier skidded a box in front of Ilyian, the shouts growing louder. He had to go now. Jostling with his belt, Sibier latched it on, fumbling as he rushed. Come on! Come on! Snatching his jacket from the wall, he slung it over his shoulders, racing to leave the rebel encampment. Lights blinded him as he leapt outside — break the heavens, it looked like it was day. Crossing over the bridge to their island marched the Darkened Dawn: a force of nearly a thousand... against his mere one hundred. And they glowed like they came straight from the skies themselves, they had so much glowstone. Their blades glinted in the light, shields dazzling as their cloaks fluttered eerily behind. 
        Sibier grimaced. They were going to get slaughtered. 
        Blinking off the light, he scanned for Karia, yet she was nowhere to be found. Skies! He had to find his community a way to escape, and Karia would know how. But she wasn’t here. Where was she! 
        </Karia> “Sibier!” Terit called out, bounding towards him. He held his sword in his hand, his hair ruffled against his face in the wind. Already, yells filled the air, the screams of death more violent than the crashes of thunder. Watchmen died. 
        The massacre had begun. 
        Sibier squinted. This couldn’t be happening! Not when everything had been going so well! Blast it all!  </Karia> “Terit, go get those who can’t fight and get them as far away as you can.” He had to save those he could.
        Terit frowned, determined. </Sibier> “I will not pass this chance to be heroic again, Siber. Yorin died fighting; I will not step away.”
        Sibier blinked. What! We can’t win this battle! 
        Terit continued, resolve settling into his bones. </The Darkened Dawn> “Sibier, they respect you. You take them to safety. Let us buy you some time.”
        Sibier bit his lip, nausea churning in his stomach. He didn’t like it, but what choice was there? Terit was right: they needed more time to escape. But sending the Vagrant to fight would be suicide — anyone who went with him would have to pay that price.  A tear rolled down his cheek, feeling that same hurt. That hurt he had felt when his parents had died. That hurt he had felt when he heard of Werrin’s and Shem’s death. That agony he had felt when Trent killed Yorin. That despair plagued him. And now, once again, he had to leave. Like when he ran from his parents. Like when he ran with the harnesses. His lips quivered; he didn’t dare speak. But slowly, he nodded. He understood.
        And it made him feel sick. He sucked in air, trying to stop the tears. Skies, this couldn’t be happening!
        Terit smirked. </Sibier> “And I'll give them a taste of the blasted depths.”
        </Sibier> “Thank you,” Sibier whispered. He turned to leave, but stopped his heart pounding in his chest. He wished he would’ve had just another moment with his parents… he wouldn’t give up that moment now with Terit. 
Sibier spun back around, throwing his arms around Terit. He held him tightly in the embrace, tears dripping out of his eyes. </The Heti> “May the skies bless you.”
 Terit stood still, a small grin on his features, his lips twitching. Sibier sniffed, pulling away. </The Heti> “Give them a taste of those depths,” he choked.
Terit grinned, then winked. </Sibier> “For Yorin.”
Then, Sibier plunged back down into the rebel encampment — maybe never again to see Terit. But he had to keep moving. This was war. 
Squaring his shoulders, Sibier lifted his head high, letting his military coat fall behind him. Frightful faces greeted him, their eyes wide with terror, and he gathered them. There was more than he thought. He swallowed, feeling dread rise like bile. How am I going to lead all these people to safety? He bit his lip, pushing people forwards. He had to find a way. I am going to find a way. They needed him to find a way.
Or else they would all die. Or else everything he had worked for in the past months would be for nothing. Or else his parent’s dream would never happen. All for nothing. 
        Sibier shook his head, spinning on his heels. Not now. Focus. Grabbing Ilyian roughly, he ignored his little brother’s cries. His tiny palms clawed at Sibier’s hands as he fought against him, tearing away at his heart. Sibier couldn’t get Terit out of his mind, couldn’t help but think that any moment his sword would clash against intruders. He ordered around people in a daze, the sickening feeling growing in him. Consuming him. He had failed another. Not now. 
        Focus!
        Skidding to a halt, Sibier raised his voice, addressing the group of nearly thirty: old men and women, little children and those pregnant and sick. This is not a group who should be running for their lives. And they deserve someone much more competent than me to save them. This is what his promises to them had led them too. Had he really helped them? Had he really helped Yorin? Had he really helped Terit?
        Shatter the skies. He couldn’t be thinking like that. Focus! 
        Once he got these people to safety, he was going to kill every blasted last one of the Darkened Dawn. He would laugh as he snapped their bones — he would grin as he watched them bleed. Maybe then they would finally understand the pain they bring. The pain he felt.
        Inside, he felt the heat rise, the anger uncontrollable. The fire was ready to explode. Terit was going to die… and, break the heavens, he would be avenged
        </The Heti> “Follow me,” he commanded the crowd. </Sibier> “If you're able, help someone with you. We need to get out of here now!”
        They nodded, deadly silent. Every one understood the intensity hanging in the air — except Ilyian. Skies! He loved his brother, but now was not the blasted time to have a tantrum. He pinched Ilyian a little harder than he should have.
        Gingerly grabbing the arm of a wizened lady, Sibier shoved the group forwards, aching at their slow pace. At this rate, the Darkened Dawn would have no problems catching up… and then slaughtering them all. He barred images of Trent crushing his parents. That would not happen again. Sibier gritted his teeth. Not today.
        But it was going to happen. He had let Terit go to his death. To the depths with it all! 
        Rounding a corner, Sibier spotted the sacs of food they had stolen. They stood upright at the end of the hall, innocent of all the bloodshed that would be spilt tonight because of them. Break the Heavens! He had known it to be a bad idea to steal from the Darkened Dawn, so why did the skies demand he do it? Maybe he didn’t hear them right. Maybe the skies were a hoax.
        Sibier bit his lip: he didn’t want to think about it. Not here. Not now. Not today. 
        The skies were good. He wouldn’t believe anything else. Then why would they take his parents from him? The heat of his anger flared. Then why would they take Werrin? Shem? His breath felt hot. Then why would they take Yorin? Why would they take Terit tonight? 
        Not now! Focus! 
        Heavy footsteps echoed from the other end of the hall, just as Sibier and his group reached the bags. Only fifty more feet until the open air. He only hoped those footfalls weren’t coming for them. If they were, then Terit’s sacrifice would be for nothing...
        Halting the group, Sibier swallowed. Fear pricked his skin like sharp quills, digging into his agony. Sprinting towards the exit, he searched for the noise.
        Skies. 
        Sure enough, fifty Darkened Dawn marched just twenty yards away, heading straight to cut him off. There was no way he would be able to get the people to safety: they had been intercepted. 
        Break the heavens. Blast the stars! He clenched his fists, squeezing the pommel of his sword. Today, they would all die. And it was their fault. Stupid skies. He had trusted them. To the depths with the skies.
        Sibier drew his sword. Weakness seeped into his fingers as he realized the impossibility of his task, but he would keep them away from Ilyian as long as he could. It wasn’t much to give, but curses, it was something. More than the skies had ever given him. 
        Tone flat, he turned to his stumbling group. </Sibier> “Run.”
        A harsh laugh. The scratch of metal rubbing against metal. The harsh vibration of words. </The Heti> “They can hide,” a Darkened Dawn chuckled, </The Heti> “but we will find them.” He smiled, his grin immaculate. 
        Hate churned in Sibier’s stomach as he tightened his grip on his sword, eyes narrowing. He knew that man — everyone did. Roc Thorthan, the leader of the Darkened Dawn himself, had come to ensure Sibier’s execution himself. His rage exploded. The purple elixir in his arm flared, glowing through his jacket. He would fight here. Skies, he would die here.
        Sniffing, Sibier squared his jaw, firm in his stance. Blast that man. He was going nowhere near Ilyian — not if Sibier could help it. He had lived for the people in his community, and now he got a chance to die for them. 
        He would not forsake the honor he has earned now. 
        Alone he stood. 
        Not Forlorn. But Alone. 
        Sibier had carved his place in this kingdom, and in his final moments, he would prove it was worth something. He fought for those who accepted him; he fought for those who had placed their faith in him. He fought for those who had trusted him, and now he wasn’t about to betray them like the skies had betrayed him. 
        Not today. Not now.
        He may be fighting alone. He may be fighting one against fifty. He may only be a single kid, without training or experience. 
        But he would not falter. 
        Not today. Not now.
        </It> “These people are mine, and you will go nowhere near them,” Sibier seethed.
        Roc tentatively swung his sword, almost playfully. He showed no fear, but only cocky indifference — to him, Sibier meant nothing. </It> “I have found that bold words do not cut like a sword. And I wield both.”
        Sibier snarled. </Sibier> “But I have family. I have people who trust me, people who will defend me, people who believe. You may have title, prowess. Skill. But you are forlorn: your cult does not love you.”
        Roc’s eyes twinkled, enjoying this little bout. </Sibier> “Killing you will be fun. I can take away what you have, but you can never take away what I have earned.”
        Sibier narrowed his eyes in challenge. </Sibier> “I wouldn’t be so sure.”
        </Siber> “Really?” Roc’s blade cut through air quicker than Sibier’s heart could beat. 
        Skidding to the side, Sibier whipped his sword around, barely blocking the blow. His heart hammered in his chest, feeling overwhelmed. But that fire. It raged inside of him, that anger. That hate. It felt good to let it all lose.
        It was time to prove who Sibier Starling truly was. It was time to show them all. This was his war. 
        They would taste of his anger. They would taste of his heat. They would taste his blade. He would die fighting. He would die fighting for them. 
        For Ilyian. 
        For Shem. For Werrin. For Yorin. For dad. For mom. For Terit.
        Twisting away, Sibier flinched when their swords clashed again, feeling the pommel jostle in his hands. Skies, no one hits that hard. No one hits that fast. But he wasn’t fighting just anyone, but Roc Thorthan. Yet, Sibier wasn’t just anyone. No, he was Sibier Starling. The only survivor of The Trials.
        The survivor. 
        Unlike when he fought Trent, Roc was not injured. This time, he didn’t have Yorin to back him up when he was knocked down. He was alone. Forlorn by the blasted skies. He never needed them anyways.  
        Gritting his teeth, Sibier barely saw the next attack coming. He slipped to the right, his sword flashing. Sibier squinted against the squeal as the metal smashed together, the pommel of his sword ripping his skin — flying out of his grasp. It bent against stone. Blast it! 
        Roc didn’t slow. 
        The man twisted as though he was a tornado, his next strike blazing. Roc’s blade slammed into Sibier’s left arm. In a moment of desperation, Sibier inhaled a sharp breath of air, stealing the steel's durability. His heart pounded in his chest.
        Roc’s sword shattered. 
        Grimacing, Sibier flung his arm at Thorthan, struggling with its weight. Roc wasn’t prepared. No amount of training taught prepared him for something deemed impossible. No amount of training prepared him for Siber Starling. His fist smashed Thortan’s nose. It hit like iron.
        Roc Thortan, the leader of the Darkened Dawn, dropped to the ground screaming like an infant. Blood covered his face, his nose horribly disfigured. Weaponless. Defeated.
        Bested.
        Panting, Sibier released the heaviness, glaring at the Darkened Dawn. Challenging them. He felt confidence pulse through him, spreading like a wild bonfire. It heated that anger. That rage. The Darkened Dawn had come to slaughter them; he would be just as willing to do the same.
        The Darkened Dawn hesitated, standing with blades drawn. They glanced about, eyes wide.
        None of them had seen magic before. None of them knew what he did, and none of them knew what he could do. But they knew he could do something. 
        And that kept them away. 
        Sibier tore off his sleeve, showing the purple veins bleeding through him. A gasp ran through the men, as Roc mumbled incoherent curses on the ground. He stood there, basking in purple light as his chest rose slowly up and down. His fingers twitched. His voice was even. </Icar> “Leave now.”
        Skies, I will kill them all. They were trying to take away Ilyian from him. They were going to kill his brother. To the depths with him. Sibier raised his sword, and pointed it at the legion in front of him. </Sibier> “I said ‘Leave now!’”
        But one Darkened Dawn charged him, crying vengeance.
        And the rest followed.
________________
Who Am I
Chapter Thirty[cy]-Three
























        Break the heavens! What in the world is that idiot doing! Nestled deep in the grass, Trent peered at Sibier. A single man facing a legion. Idiot. 
Fingering his pommel, he bit his lip. The Darkened Dawn’s forces were still aligning themselves, and he didn’t want any of their men to escape. If they all died in this ambush here, then none could warn the other half of their army. 
This was going to be a massacre.
All he had to do was wait.
Yet, a tiny piece of his heart throbbed. The kid, Sibier, was going to die if Trent didn’t intervene to save him.  The person who reminded him so much of who he was… the person who could still change the world. He had to do something… right? 
Trent narrowed his eyes. No. He didn’t have to do anything for that swine. He looked down at his missing palm, feeling the anguish churn inside of him. Trent’s fury ignited. His past self was dead, and all that remained was coldness. Emotionless passion. He could never return to who he was, and Sibier was his enemy. He could almost taste the revenge as he envisioned plunging his sword into the kid’s gut. Trent would make it hurt. 
He itched to stomp across the grass and challenge Sibier right then and there. He felt like a boulder on top of a cliff, and any second a gust of wind would push it down the mountain — never to stop until it crushed anything in its way. But Trent clenched his fist, holding himself back. He wasn’t here to kill the kid. He was here for the Darkened Dawn. Trent took a deep breath, trying to relax. Trying to calm down. Sibier would die to the Darkened Dawn… he didn’t have to do it. Kill him.
Trent frowned. Although the Darkened Dawn would kill Sibier, they wouldn’t do a good enough job. He dug his boot in the ground, pouting like a child. His sneer seemed to cement on his face, growing angrier every second. Kill him, his anger demanded. Trent licked his lips.
He wasn’t stupid enough to stop them. It was to his advantage to wait, allowing the Darkened Dawn to bundle themselves together as a gift for him. They were almost there. KILL HIM. 
Trent squinted, feeling as though his emotion was about to rip out of his stomach. He unsheathed his blade… Skies! Blinking, he put away his sword. He still felt that heat inside of him, but he felt something else. Fear? Am I scared? 
Trent fell backwards, landing dazed on his butt. Panting. Had I really let anger control me so much! What was he going to do? Kill the kid he respected? He shivered, disgusted by the heat inside of him. That emotionless passion… skies, it had become a part of him. Heavens above, help me. 
In his stupor, Trent almost missed it. He needed to reposition his forces. Trent motioned his hand forwards. Several of his men shifted, crossing over a bridge in the cover of darkness, cutting off any escape. Just a little while longer. Skies, he didn’t have the time to be distracted. Get control of yourself! But with the anger pushing up against him, Trent felt ready to fall over at any moment. To lose himself to the High Executioner. 
He hit his stomach. He took in a sharp breath. He ground his teeth together. Focus, he growled at himself. Skies! Just focus! Focus on the blasted battle; skies to the depths with you! 
The ambush was going… skies, it was too easy. In his haste to steal back the food, Roc had grown desperate, forgetting to check on his surveyors. Now, all seven of them were dead, and the Darkened Dawn would have no alert on the ambush. Their legion of fifty would be quickly overwhelmed. Trent closed his eyes, trying to study himself. The ensuing battle wasn’t even worth his attention, not like… like the anger inside of him. 
Kill Sibier, it whispered. He tried to move his fingers, but there was no hand to listen. Kill Sibier...
Trent’s eyes snapped open. He couldn’t dare listen to that feeling — he had to focus. He had to. He swallowed. Focus. 
A man broke off from the front of the group, his stride strong and unquestionable. Trent squinted his eyes. Thorthan? He shook his head, disbelieving. It couldn’t be: the man isn’t that stupid. 
Too easy… his mind glanced back at the anger, longing for its hold. No. 
Shifting, Trent readied himself. It strained him holding back the relief of battle, the absence of feeling, the soothing forgetfulness of rage. He craved it, hungered for it. Now, he lived in the heated moments of battle, everything else just in between. It was who he was.
It wasn’t who he wanted to be. 
His heart still beats for Sibier. Still pained him to watch the kid shake as he raised his sword, shivering with fear. Still made him remember…
Idiot! Stop thinking! Trent snarled, silencing those thoughts. The past was gone, and the only thing that mattered was destroying the Darkened Dawn. Domination — he would have it, and he would save his family from another Gilit. Nothing else mattered. The anger was getting dangerously close, and Trent let it touch him. The heat was invigorating. 
Stop! Panting, Trent separated himself from the emotion. He couldn’t feel that. He couldn’t feel for Sibier either. He had to focus. He could only save his family. Nothing — no one — else mattered.
The Darkened Dawn’s sword bashed against Sibier’s, as they locked in combat. Clearly, the syndicate member’s skill outshone Sibier’s as he forced the kid back, trapping him in a corner. In three quick strikes, Sibier was already disarmed. 
The Darkened Dawn didn’t even hesitate to deliver the killing blow. Trent felt no relief. Trent felt no joy in his revenge. No glee. No happiness.
But guilt.
Skies. Trent silenced the feeling. Yes, he could have saved the boy, but it was too late now. He didn’t have time for remorse. He was above feeling. He was above emotion. All that mattered was crushing the Darkened Dawn. Forget Sibier. 
The sword shattered against Sibier’s arm. 
Trent blinked. Shatter the skies. Maybe he would get his blasted wish after all: maybe he would be able to strangle the kid. He ignored the flowering respect inside of him for the kid. He pushed aside the anger.
Stumbling forwards, Sibier swung his fist, his knuckles pounding against the Darkened Dawn. The man dropped to the ground, blood spurting. Uneasily, the rest of their force went rigid, tight silence hanging them like the ropes at the gallows. Sibier stood — taller than he should be — his rugged hair contrasting his sharp features. Starlight glittered on his face. 
Trent held up his palm, ready to signal his men to attack. The Darkened Dawn had gathered themselves together — now was the right moment. But, he hesitated. He wanted to watch this.
Because for once, Trent was inspired. He had been wrong. Very wrong. 
Trent had never been like Sibier: this kid had something more. This was a kid who knew what he was doing. This was a kid who was able to win when he shouldn’t. This was a kid who could keep his vows. Who could be true to himself. 
Jealousy or respect — Trent didn’t know which it was — rose up within him like bile. His instincts craved to fight, yet he held still. The anger swirled around him, taunting him and baiting him, but it seemed quiet. He couldn’t seem to hear it, as he stood there. Stood there… simply confused.
No longer knowing why he waited. 
No longer knowing who he was. 
What am I doing?
Sibier said something, though the meaning of his words were lost to Trent’s ears. The Darkened Dawn legion shifted nervously, unsure what to do next. Then, finally, somebody attacked. And with them, their army surged. 
A single man. Alone. Against fifty. 
I hate myself, Trent scowled. But somehow this blasted kid had won over his heart again, even though Trent didn’t even know he still had one. Even though he wanted to kill Sibier himself, there was no way he was letting him be bested by impossibility. There was still nobility left in the kingdom — there was still some good remaining. 
And even in his emotionless state, Trent still remembered his promise years ago. Maybe, maybe just for tonight, he could honor it again. 
Lifting his sword high in the air, Trent charged, a guttural growl bursting from him.
By the blood in my veins, I will fight for those who cannot. I will kill for those who will be killed. And I will save those who will save.
At least, he would tonight.
________________
The Heavens Don’t Break
Chapter Thirty-Four
























        Blood matted his hair, coating his sweat in stickiness. 
        Sibier couldn’t last much longer. 
        He felt his muscles tiring, the aching pain of various cuts protesting as he pushed away, shielding himself with his arm. Metal crashed against his skin, but it held firm like metal — but skies, it hurt. 
        Grimacing, Sibier stepped back, giving up his bottleneck. He needed a momentary break from the fighting, but retreating meant he was about to be surrounded. A death sentence. Coughing, his eyes burned with defiance, his anger swelling within him. 
        I will kill them all. He lifted a sword from the ground, his fingers strangling the pommel. His eyes darted back and forth as a snarl lifted his lips. Sibier grinned at the fear in the men he fought, testing him like a savage beast. He was cornered, but he didn’t want out. He only wanted to kill as many as he could… and make them hurt. Make them bleed and cry to the stars who had abandoned them. They never listened to Sibier’s pleas — they wouldn’t listen to theirs.
Sibier blinked. No, that wasn’t what he wanted. No, that wasn’t what he was fighting for. No, no. He bit his lip, retreating away from the battle; luckily, the Darkened Dawn approached warily. He was fighting to cause pain — he was fighting to stop pain. To protect a place where the people could work together. He was fighting to buy time for them to escape.
Sibier’s rage deflated. That senseless energy drained from him, as he slumped his shoulders, feeling the wind against his cheek. The black colors from the Darkened Dawn’s clothing smothered his view, drowning out any hope. Tears streamed down his cheeks where seconds before blazed passion. But now, he saw what he was doing. Now, he understood the magnitude. Now, he actually felt doomed. 
He was going to die here. He knew it. But this was his sacrifice. He had chosen it. Skies, he was going to die here. 
He closed his eyes, breathing in. He held his blade wardingley, standing firm. I have given them my all. Sibier only hoped that the people behind him had found the time to hide. Most of them would die, but he hoped some would survive. It was a wish. Potentially a barren hope. But he had to believe. 
        He couldn’t bear to imagine that they would all be killed with a sword through their chest. Because of his decision. 
        He couldn’t bear to imagine Ilyian with hollowed out eyes. A blade through his innocent body, his mouth curled into an everlasting scream. Sibier’s eyes snapped open. No. Not today. Not now.
        Heavens above, he would fulfill his blasted promise to those people. They will have that community. His parents would see their dream become reality from the stars. This was it. He couldn’t fail. He wouldn’t fail.
        Not today. Not now.
        Growling, Sibier leapt forwards swinging. I will not let them have him! No matter what, he was not going to fail. This was his moment. This was his sacrifice. He couldn’t let them have Ilyian. Not now. Not today. He had protected Ilyian for four years, and he wasn’t going to stop. To the depths with anyone who said otherwise. Blast them.
        He would kill all fifty of the Darkened Dawn. He would shatter the skies too if that’s what it took. Nothing was getting their hands on Ilyian. No one was touching his brother. 
        And nothing else mattered.
        Cheeks flushed with conviction, he ducked a strike, slamming his fist into a stomach. The Darkened Dawn stumbled back, coughing blood. Not many can withstand a punch harder than steel. But blasting it, using his magic hurt. Yet, he would do it if it protected Ilyian.
        Fingers skimming the ground, he released the power, his arm returning to normal as he rolled forwards. Steel cut earth around him, his breathing sharp and focused. For Ilyian.
        A slash from the right. He sidestepped left. 
        For Ilyian.
        A kick from behind. He jumped. 
        For Ilyian.
        A jab. He caught it. 
        Blast it! For Ilyian!
        Yanking the blade forwards, Sibier tore the blade out of the man’s grip, but it took too long. A kick slammed into his back, and he stumbled forwards. Unbalanced, he tripped, barely getting his left arm in front of an incoming blade. 
        Metal crashed against a hardened arm. He winced.
        The force however banged Sibier’s head into the ground. His sight flickered, as the stars glittered unstable above him. They twinkled uninvolved above, uncaring about Sibier’s impending doom. 
        Skies. 
        Gritting his teeth, Sibier’s eyes were fiere as they locked with his opponents. The Darkened Dawn leapt, his sword slashing down. Grimacing, Sibier threw his metallic arm in front, catching the weapon. Death was coming. 
        Had I survived long enough? 
        He saw Ilyian in the back of his mind, crying as he was carried by a frantic elder, struggling to even walk. He saw Ilyian begging to see him again, as the little kid stared wide eyed at the approaching enemy. As the kid sobbed as the Darkened Dawn began to massacre…
        NO! That couldn’t happen! Skies, it couldn’t. It couldn’t happen. He wouldn’t let it. It couldn’t happen! Skies!
        Not today. Not now.
        His muscles flaunted. His skin tore, blood dripping from his pores. My arm can’t handle how much magic I’ve been using, he realized. Yet, now was not the time to stop. They could not have Ilyian. Ever.
        </The Heti> “Urchin, give up. You have already lost,” the man growled, pressing down his blade. It inched closer to Sibier’s throat, its tip nearly touching his skin. He had seconds.
        Flat on his back, Sibier clenched his eyes closed, bracing his arm. Forcing everything he had up against his opponent. Just. Trying. To. Buy. 
Time. 
        He was a dead man, but he could make his life worth more still. Sibier took a deep breath, seeing his mother and father in his head. As they served together, and in their final moments, fought to give Sibier a chance to escape. They hadn’t fought for their lives — they had fought for his. 
        Sibier breathed in, the air feeling like fire in his throat. I’m not fighting to save myself, but to save a nation. To save Ilyian. In the end, he would die just like his parents had: in honor. With diligence and courage. They had seen to their duty to the end, and Sibier would see his completed as well. 
        He had a promise to keep. And skies, he would keep it. 
        </Sibier> “Go to the depths.”
        The Darkened Dawn frowned, thrusting the blade down. Sibier rolled, the steel glancing at his neck. A stream of blood poured out as he rolled to his feet, lifting a sword. He whirled around, feeling fire burn within him. An unquenchable bonfire of valor. Resilience and selflessness. Conviction.
Three swords slashed at him. 
Sibier leapt, closing his eyes and knowing this was his final moment. He couldn’t stop all the blades, but he could use his. He could take down just one of them — meant one less person to search for Ilyian. Steel echoed with clambering brutality, as shouts rang through the air. No scorching pain. No metal tearing through his skin. No sword sticking through him. 
Not yet, at least. And that was all he hoped for. 
His blade ripped through the Darkened Dawn’s heart. </I> “You will never have him,” Sibier whispered. 
Still no blades pierced Sibier. Heavens above. Am I dead?
He opened his eyes. All three of the Darkened Dawn who had lunged at him were dead. Sibier had only killed one. 
Shocked, he glanced at the stars, amazed. </I> “Why?” he mumbled, a tear in his eyes. </Icar> “Why save me now?”
No more of the Darkened Dawn tried surging against him, and Sibier finally saw why.
Like a torrent of wind, Trent blew through the men like a hurricane. And pressing against their ranks was the royal army. 
Sibier dropped to his knees. Thank you.
They wouldn’t have Ilyian. 
Not today. Not now.

Dawn Again
Chapter Thirty-Five
























        Trent grimaced.
        Break the heavens. He didn’t believe it. 
        Wiping his blade clean, Trent sheathed the weapon, staring at the moaning buffoon, clutching his broken nose like a whining toddler. Besides him lay nearly fifty dead members of the Darkened Dawn. 
        Trent smiled. It had been a massacre. 
        Inside, his passion burned: a red hot flare of rage. It enveloped him, and he welcomed its chilling respite. He didn’t think about the lives he just took, the widows he just created... the children without fathers — they didn’t matter. Only the anger, the heat, the momentum of killing. Only the numbing excitement that tingled his bones, that transformed him into a murderer. He had left Trent behind, and now it was time to be the High Executioner. 
        Oh, how he loved its warmth. 
        He sheathed his sword. Grabbing Roc Thorthan roughly by the collar, the High Executioner lifted the man off of his heels. Thorthan choked, spitting swallowed blood. Trent relished the slow recognition, grinning as fear crept across the swine’s face. Roc knew what was coming. 
        Trent exhaled, his breath drifting over the Darkened Dawn’s leader. He tightened his grasp around the man’s throat, his fingers squinching out air. He didn’t speak — doing so would only interrupt his fiery hate. That thirst for more. Kill him, the voice whispered. Oh, he loved it. 
        It was the only thing keeping him from the lurking pain. The pain that never seemed to go away. The pain that was Trent. Away with it. Away with him. 
        The High Executioner sniffed. He wasn’t Trent. Instead, he was just a brutal killer — one who finally got his revenge. Roc Thorthan deserved the cruelest death he could give. And he would give it with a grin across his features.
        It would fuel the flames.
        Desperate, Thorthan gaped, scraping at Trent’s arm. He tore off skin, but the High Executioner only smiled. Pain. I love pain. Quickly, Thorthan’s resistance weakened, his face becoming reminiscent of a blueberry. 
        And Trent saw the pure terror in the man’s eyes. Like he was staring at a monster. A devil. Fiend. Not human. 
        Selean had those same eyes. 
        Blast it. He remembered her soft face roll up in horror as she watched him tear through men. That hurting look of betrayal she held when he obeyed King Icar in the cell. He heard her mourning shriek. It haunted him. Once again, the pain returned. In full, overwhelming force. 
        Trent was still alive. And, burning skies, he loved his sister. Heavens above, what have I done? His hand went slack, dropping a body. 
        Then he saw a kid. A kid with his sword outstretched, his matted hair slick with sweat. A kid with the same piercing eyes he had, the same unquenchable thirst to do what was right — except Trent’s had been extinguished.
        He didn’t have to kill Sibier. He didn’t have to. Yet, that anger still swam within him, still riled him. He was still the High Executioner too… Trent clenched his fists; that fool had taken his hand. It was time to get revenge. Kill him. 
        But Selean’s frightened eyes were bright in his mind. The rage, the anger, the blinding hatred — it all seemed dim compared to her. He couldn’t do it: he couldn’t kill Sibier. I will save those who save. Because of Selean. Because he loved his sister. 
        Sibier’s eyes locked with his, as the boy spoke. </Icar> “Let us be.”
        Trent frowned, the boiling anger simmering underneath his fractured resolve. Skies, I hurt. </Sibier> “Get out of my way; my quarry isn’t with you.”
        </Icar> “You can’t have them,” Siber swallowed. He looked at the men backing Trent nervously, shifting his stance. He didn’t move from the entrance of the rebel hideout. Trent wasn’t surprised.
        The kid is a blasted buffoon. </Icar> “Move Sibier, or I will cut off your head and the Darkened Dawn’s,” Trent growled. </The High Executioner> “I don’t need more blood.” This is for you Selean. He closed his eyes, focusing on her memory. Where was Selean now? 
        Sibier blinked, dumbfounded. </The High Executioner> “Are you here to save us?”
        Idiot. If the memory of Selean wasn’t fresh in his mind, he would crush that kid’s irritating throat. Striding forwards, Trent shoved Sibier aside, marching into the cave. Bags of food lined the walls — a flower of respect bloomed inside of him: he hadn’t expected their raid to be so successful. Heavens above, that much food could last years. Wow. 
        That was exactly what a rebellion army would need. 
        Trent rubbed his eyes, his black glove stretching. Could I go back to that life? Could I become that man again? Could I be the hero I once was? Striding through the caverns, the pain seemed to vanish momentarily — a heavenly relief. I can. I can go back. I can be that man again. I can be the hero. 
        Surprisingly, Trent felt something stir deep inside of him. He craved it. But down there also lurked the pain. The regret. The anger. Skies, he was a mess. 
        Instead of striding down the encampment, Trent slowed, his eyes widening as he began to saunter. He remembered this. His troops training in the hall. Karia hunched over, scribbling away at a map. Yes, yes. Trent’s chest puffed, as he fought tears from his eyes. Yes, he remembered this. 
        Skies, how he missed this! 
        He had strategized there — in that broken stool with only three legs —  plotting how to route Icar’s forces from the Henti square. He had stood here — with uniform tight and hair trimmed — practicing the strange Bowley’s formation. He had been the hero here — with straight back shoulders — proud of who he was… proud of what he was doing. Trent swallowed, running his fingers through the dust on the table. It had been a long time. Could he go back?
        Could he be that hero he had been?
        Trent’s gaze shifted around the room, his eyes lingering on a small crevice.  He strolled over to it, taking in the familiar scents of earthy rock, sweat and firewood, remembering. This had been his home. He had lived here for nearly eight months, and it felt like he had never left. But the man who had lived here never knew of how badly he would fail. That he would be the one to throw it all away. 
        A single tear dribbled down Trent’s cheek. I hate myself. He wished he could do anything to go back to what he had. He wished he could, if only for a day, live back to when he was fighting. Yes, he collapsed into his bed every night. Yes, his stomach always growling at the rations. Yes, his skin was torn, broken and bruised. But back then, he had hope. But back then, he had Karia. 
        Back then, he had his family. 
        Skies, I hate myself. All of that is gone now. Heavens above, he didn’t have any of that anymore. All because of him. All because he had clung too tightly to it all. If anyone deserved to drown in the depths, it was him. It was the man who claimed he was the High Executioner, but really deep down, it was the same person he had always been. It was Trent.
        Exhaling, Trent reached into the crevice, his fingers brushing scorched cloth. He breathed a sigh of relief. It was still there. 
        Carefully, he slid out the piece of cloth. Thin lines of charcoal faded away on it, but the words still were vibrant in his mind. He didn’t need to read it to know what it said, and he didn’t even look at the words. Instead, he clenched it tight in his palm, finally just feeling. With his eyes closed, he breathed deeply through his nose, holding onto that cloth. Remembering. Feeling. 
        There was regret. Anguish. There was suffering. Pain. Agony. There was rage. Anger. Vehemence. Fury. He had always had those emotions. Because with them, he also felt healing. Peace. Hope. Tranquility. 
        He finally felt what it meant to be Trent again. He missed this. He missed Karia. He missed… Trent sniffed… he missed his family. Skies, his mom. Heavens above, help me. 
        He needed to be that hero again. He had to be. But even now, he felt the High Executioner looming over him, waiting for him to slip. Even now, he could feel its fiery breath cascading down his neck. Even now…
        I need to be that hero. 
        Yet, wasn’t that already what he was doing? Saving the kingdom from another Gilit? Stopping the Heti from arriving on shore and destroying the entire kingdom? Was he not destroying the guild of the Darkened Dawn, and pledging food for the people? Didn’t that constitute being a hero?
        Maybe I have always been the hero, Trent realized. No. That wasn’t true. These last months, he had not been a hero. Yet... yet, it didn’t matter who he was. It only mattered who he would be now.
        And that was Trent. 
        He tightened his grip around the cloth. Remembering those words. Remembering Karia’s blowing auburn hair. Remembering the slick sheen of his sword — the day his dad had passed it onto him. Remembering why he strapped on his belt everyday. Remembering the reason he chose to roll out of bed. Hadn’t he slumbered long enough? 
        Burning skies, it's time. Time to make my family proud. He never wanted to see Selean’s horrified face again. He wanted Sasha to call him brother again. He wanted his dad to forgive him for his mother’s death. 
        Heavens above, I will kill that man. 
        </They> “Run!” a voice screamed. Trent jolted, remembering why he was here; he knew that voice. Quickly, he tucked away the cloth into his pocket, wiping away the tears. His soldiers didn’t need to see that. 
        </The High Executioner> “This way,” the same voice ordered. Footsteps pounded down the hallway, echoing along with clanking armour. Sounds of retreat.
        Trent’s brows knitted together. The Darkened Dawn doesn’t wear armour, and neither does Sibier’s scant community. My force does. Skies. Something had gone terribly wrong. And he had been sitting here, crying over his blasted past. 
        His heart raced in his chest. He should’ve been quicker getting his men to flank the Darkened Dawn. But, heavens above, how did the Darkened Dawn get an edge on his men?
Ahead, Karia sprinted around the corner, arms waving frantically. </Sibier> “This way men! GO GO GO!” Behind her, an army scrambled. Both of the royal guard and Sibier’s community of derelicts. What was going on? 
        Karia’s eyes flashed with recognition as they met with Trent’s. </Lillian> “Get out!” she yelled to him. </Lillian> “Trent, get your men out now!”
        Trent nodded. You didn’t challenge Karia when her voice reached that tone. And a moment later, he saw why. 
        A heti rounded the corner, its purple-black skin glowing. It snarled with its fiendish form, its grin stretching impossible wide. Its veins jutted out like snaking eels, eerie as the pulsed purple. The heti appeared like a monster torn straight out of Trent’s nightmares. 
        Skies, it was here. Has it already returned to its people? Or had it yet to leave? Trent swallowed. This was bad. This was very bad. 
A man jabbed at it with his sword, surprisingly landing the blow. It did nothing. Spinning with inhumane flexibility, the heti grabbed the blade, crushing it between its fingers like paper. Its skin took on a metallic hue, as its other arm swung its own sword. 
        Despite his bravery, the man stood no chance. Dead.
        Heavens above. Today, the kingdom needed a hero.
        The Kingdom needed Trent.

Unfaltering
Chapter Thirty-six
























        People blurred by Sibier as he squeezed to the side, pushing against the tide. Something was coming, and he would stand in between it and his people. Nothing was getting to Ilyian. Nothing was getting to his people. Nothing was going to crush his dreams. This was his battle. This was his fight. 
        And he would fight it to the bloody end. 
        An elderly woman held Ilyian to her breast, as she slipped outside with the rest of the crowd. Good, Sibier breathed. Ilyian wouldn’t be trapped inside, thank the skies. He only had to hope that Trent’s royal army didn’t harass the people — there was nothing Sibier could guarantee for their safety. But he had to hope. 
        He bit his lip. He knew one thing: the royal guard had a lot less reason to hate them than the Darkened Dawn. He didn’t trust Trent, and his stomach squealed at the thought with Ilyian at his mercy. Skies, but the man had given him those diapers: a strange act of kindness to a person you had to deliver to the Trials. 
        At the very least there was hope. 
        Taking a deep breath, Sibier rolled up his sleeve. His arm twitched with the purple elixir as its tendrils snaked up to his chest. He had seen the Heti. It crushed through the staggering defense of both the royalty and his community’s defenses, unstoppable as it tore person after person apart. Skies. They could barely slow it down.
        Sibier felt his throat dry. I can stop it. He held that same curse that gave the Heti the advantage. Those men dying didn’t know how to fight it, but Sibier did. He had lived the last couple months hiding his curse, but now it was their blessing. He could stop the Heti. 
        This was why the skies had saved him. This was his purpose.
        Karia skidded, catching Sibier by the arm. </Lillian> “Come on, run!”
        Solemnly, Sibier dimly shook his head. </Lillian> “I can stop it,” he whispered. </Sibier> “It has to be me.” He stood firm, and he didn’t shake. 
        Eyes darting, Karia kept the group moving — they had made it to the bags of food. Almost out. </Sibier> “Sibier, you can only escape it,” she refuted, her face wild. </Selean> “You cannot fight it!”
        He gave a knowing smile, as he strode into the center of the hall, directly in front of the bags of food. Torches sputtered with inconsistent light nearby on the walls, illuminating his face in an eerie pattern. His scorched arm glowed purple. </Sibier> “I’m not fighting it; I'm killing it.”
        Karia’s eyes widened, pulling him back. By now, he could see the Darkened Dawn’s army marching into the room, following the Heti. </Sibier> “You can’t Sibier — the Heti won’t die. We’ve hit it with swords... blast it Sibier! You’ll get yourself killed!.”
Sibier met her gaze, gently pushing her away. He understood what he was doing. </Selean> “Karia, please. Go.”
Karia swallowed, then nodded. Her hair stuck to her face, covered with sweat. Her mouth opened, but no words came out. Finally, she turned, ushering the rest of the crowd through. She took a look back. Sibier smiled. This was my choice. 
Drawing his sword, Sibier narrowed his eyes at the approaching Heti. It bounded towards him with unnatural grace, uncannily fluid. Why doesn’t it attack the Darkened Dawn? Did they create the heti? Are the Instigators working for them? Sibier took a deep breath, trying to silence his nerves. Those answers didn’t matter. There was only one thing that did: the Heti wasn’t getting to Ilyian.
Not today. Not now.
His heart hammered in his chest. He rubbed the grit off his fingers. He ran his nails down the length of his blade. They couldn’t have Ilyian. 
Eyes burning with a fiery determination, Sibier squared his shoulders. Defiant. Proud. Bold. </Sibier> “You can’t have them.” The demand fell with icy confidence, even though his breath shivered with uncertainty. He felt his muscles twitch at the impossibility of his task, but he would. Not. Retreat. Not an inch. 
Not today. Not now.
</Sibier> “What can’t I have?” th[cz][da]e Heti chuckled, blackened lips tantalizingly mesmerizing as they stretched, the purple veins glowing. 
Sibier tightened his grip on his sword, stomaching his fear. Skies, give me a miracle. </It> “My friends. My family.”
The Heti slowed to a halt, fingering a bag of food. Every word he spoke sounded like grinding rocks, a faint purple mist escaping its mouth with every exhale. </Selean> “Everything you have is granted by us. Everything here is ours, and we can take what we wish. Your friends and family will join the tribute.”
Rage kindled in Sibier’s chest. He felt blood pump through his arms rhythmically, pulsing with the beat of fury. Nothing was getting to his family, and definitely Ilyian wasn’t becoming any sort of tribute. Burning skies, the Heti was not taking anything. He sniffed.
Not today. Not now.
The Heti glanced back at the approaching Darkened Dawn, still hundreds of yards away. He held up his sword, pointing it at Sibier. </Sibier> “Now get out of my way.”
Sibier gulped. </Selean> “Never.”
With a swift jab, the heti lunged. Sibier eyes widened at the unnatural movement, barely sliding out of the way. Impossibly, the Heti’s legs bended with the flexibility of seaweed but with the strength of steel. Heavens above.
Can I do that?
He blinked, focusing on surviving. The sword slashed, he ducked. Sweat dripped down Sibier’s skin as he rolled onto his feet, panting. Oh stars, please. 
He lifted his sword, blocking the next blow — he never saw the kick. The heti’s leg bent inhumanely, swiping Sibier’s legs out from underneath him. Back crushing against stone, Sibier gasped. Break the heavens. 
Squinting out the pain, Sibier rolled to his side, narrowly dodging a strike. Steel cracked besides him, as he pushed himself to his toes, blinking away tears. C’mon! Skies, I need a miracle! He hurt. His chest felt ready to burst, as he choked on blood. 
That fall. Skies, that fall had been rough. Blast it.
Wearily, Sibier scrambled back, coughing. His ribs stung, throbbing with pain, begging him to stop. To give up. To die. To fail those who needed him. Please, nothing be broken. Not today. Not now. He lifted his eyes to the skies, praying for a miracle. 
Hopefully they would not forsake him now. 
Hopefully, he was not forlorn.
In the corner of his eye, he caught Trent barreling into the chamber, his hair wild as he shoved aside the masses. </Sibier> “Sibier, burn the food!”
What! Why does he want me to burn the food?
The heti growled, swinging. Without a second thought, Sibier lifted his arm, shattering the steel against his wrist. Grimacing with pain, he dropped back to the floor, gasping for breath as he released the stolen hardness back into the ground. Don’t. Do. That. Again. 
Blood spilled from his mouth. Sibier pushed himself to his feet, determination lifting him. I am not beaten yet. I am not dead yet. I will fight. I will win. For Ilyian. 
The Heti roared, outraged. </Karia> “When my nation arrives, we will tear you apart for trying to steal our magic. We are your superiors, and you will have to learn your place!”
Sibier tasted blood in his throat. </Sibier> “Drown in the depths, you swine.”
Lunging, the Heti wrapped its scaled fingers around Sibier’s blade, tearing it like paper. With a worried flick of his wrist, he tossed the now featherweight sword to the side. Burn the food. 
Stepping to the right, his heart pounded in his chest. Did he trust Trent? Was it worth sacrificing years worth of food for his community just because Trent told him too? 
But a High Executioner doesn’t waste his words. Trent would have never told him to do it if it wasn’t important. Burn the food. 
He couldn’t beat the heti this way. His sword was broken, and he felt his ribs protesting. He was bruised, and he was exhausted. Barely hanging on. His duck was slow. His dodge left him with a new cut. He was out of options. He had to listen to the High Executioner. Right?
Stealing a glance at the nearest torch, Sibier barely ducked the heti’s fist. He spun away, his hair clinging to his face. Every breath was painful, his chest burning inside of him. Skies, please! A rib had to be broken. 
He wasn’t going to be able to beat the Heti this way. His only option was to trust a man who had tried to kill him. Break the heavens, I am dead. The only thing that mattered was keeping Ilyian alive. He couldn’t break his promise to his parents.
Not today. Not now.
Springing off his toes, the Heti lunged as Sibier threw a fist. His knuckles bashed the Heti’s jaw as he sidestepped, dazing the intruder momentarily. Lucky.
This was the chance he needed. 
Sibier dove for the nearest torch, ripping it out of its holster. He squinted as its flames licked his fingers, feeling the wrath of heat. He pressed it against a sac of food. 
</Sibier> “Nooo!” the heti bellowed. He punched Sibier, sending him crashing to the ground. 
That hurt. His eyes fluttered, his head spinning as though it was full of cotton. His vision darkened, its tendrils threatening to take control. Every breath felt like a blade plunged into his gut, as his veins tightened. C’mon! Get up! Stumbling to his feet, Sibier readied himself, preparing for a punch, yet the Heti didn’t attack, instead extinguishing the flame. 
Taking a sharp breath, Sibier licked his bloody lips. Trent is right about one thing, the heti won’t let the food burn. A good sign. He had to hope that it would be enough to stop the Heti from coming to kill them. Skies, none of this makes sense. Why does the Heti need the food!
Heavens above, he needed water. He blinked, trying to push away the pain, but he wobbled on his feet. His head throbbed with the beat of a blacksmith’s hammer. Pounding.
The heti snarled at him. </Sibier> “You burn our tribute and I will kill every person in this kingdom!”
Sibier coughed. </Sibier> “So burn the food. Got it.” 
Purple elixir dripped from the Heti’s as he threw his fist at Sibier. He felt his fire burn inside of him, as he matched the intruder’s intensity, catching the blow.  Their fists locked together, as they struggled, wrestling. Struggling. He clenched his teeth. Blast it. 
Unbearable pain. The Heti’s fingers dug into his, the purple elixir seeping into his skin. He could almost feel the tendrils from The Trials digging into his muscles, pulsing with the purple liquid. His throat dried. His eyes widened. His legs shook. 
That fear. It came back, crashing into him like a tidal wave. His heart skipped a beat in his chest. He hyperventilated. Memories raced through his head.
No, Sibier grimaced, struggling for strength. Not today. Not now. 
He pushed back with everything he had, pressing Ilyian in the forefront of his mind. He could not lose this fight. He could not. Burning skies, I can’t lose this. He fought against the Heti, fighting with years of bent up hate, anger, rage. Struggling with years of perseverance, courage, grit. Resisting with years of hope, light, fire. He fought with everything. With his mother’s love, with his dad’s steely kindness. He fought with the sky’s light, he fought with his brother’s laughing sincerity. Sibier steeled himself, digging his heels into the ground. 
Skies, I am losing. 
But he would not lose. 
Not today. Not now.
Bellowing, Sibier remained firm underneath the Heti’s crushing grip. </Sibier> “You will never have him.” Growling, he put everything into one last push. This was it. This was it. 
For Ilyian.
Screaming, Sibier shoved the heti backwards, causing the figure to stumble back.  Trent’s blade ripped through the air. 
It barreled into the Heti, knocking him to the ground. Sibier whimpered, free for only a moment. His hands were torn, covered in red and purple blood. They boiled, burning his skin. 
Trent growled. </Sibier> “Skies, idiot! Get the torch — I’ll keep him busy!”
Shaking his hands, Sibier nodded, biting back the pain. Right. Torch. Sprinting, he felt his heart bounce up and down in his chest, every movement aching with fire. Torch. With every step, he heard the Darkened Dawn get closer. Torch. He had to get there. Torch. He had to get there for Ilyian. Torch.
Sibier dove, ignoring screams from behind him. His fingers wrapped around wood, tearing the torch from the wall. Flames sputtered as he frantically whirled it around, showering embers everywhere. 
Burn the food. 
Whirling around, Sibier’s eyes widened. A Darkened Dawn swung her sword at Sibier, just as he stumbled backwards. Skies — he had no weapons. He backed away on his heels, eyes darting as he scanned for any escape. He had to make it to the bags of food. Yet, with the Darkened Dawn’s army here, he stood no chance. In the corner of his view, Trent barely dodged a blow from the Heti.
Sibier’s time was nearly up. He needed to burn the food. Now  — there would be no second chances. Oh skies, they needed a miracle. 
He was a dead man now. But he was going to try. His sacrifice would be worth something.
Clutching the torch, he raced, feeling the fire burn within his chest. This was his final moment. And just like his parents, he was blasted going to die trying. It was not over yet.
Not today. Not now. 
The flames flickered as he dropped to his knees, sliding underneath a blow. He bounded to his feet as he dodged to the side, skating across stone. He lifted his arm up, his blackened skin deflecting a sword. 
For Ilyian. 
Growling, Sibier leapt another blade, nearly to the food. Nothing could stop him. Years of survival, years of determination and years of persistence brought him here. Now he rode on them like wind, unstoppable as he howled past. He was not going to fail his community. He was not going to fail his parents. 
He was not going to fail Ilyian.
Not today. Not now.
Diving, Sibier hit the ground in a roll, sliding the last feet to the bags of food. Surrounded by the Darkened Dawn. But he had the torch. And he was by the food. This was it. Skies, this was blasted it. 
Closing his eyes, Sibier mumbled one last prayer to the stars. Thank you. 
He set fire.

Heavens Aligned
Chapter Thirty-Seven
























The fire caught with the brilliance of a star. 
        Sibier spun around, his breathing rapid. He had to keep the flame alive. He had to make sure all the food burned. For the community. For his parents. For Ilyian. 
        And to do that, he had to fight off an army. Heavens above, that flame will not be extinguished. 
        Not today. Not now. 
        Fingers clenched tightly around the torch, Sibier skirted to the right, just as a sword slashed through the air. Determination and hope burned inside of him as he blocked a blow with his arm. He gritted his teeth. Skies, that hurt. 
        It was a miracle he was still standing. He felt ready to fall apart, his rib jutting him with every movement. His vision blurred, and his legs ached. Every cut screamed. Every bruise protested. Sibier couldn’t last forever.
        He just had to make sure all the food burned. Not much longer. Burning skies, not much longer! Heavens above, it was all going to be over soon one way or another. 
        The heti spun, knocking Trent off of his heels. The m[db]onster's gaze snapped over to him, its icy eyes landing directly on Sibier. Suddenly, his soul chilled, a shiver creeping down his spine. Its coldness froze him. How could he beat that? How could he possibly keep that from tearing apart his community? How could he ever stop it from finding Ilyian? What hope did he even have? 
        Sibier didn’t even see the sword coming. 
        But the king did. 
        Icar leapt in front of Sibier, his blade arcing, deflecting the blow aimed for Sibier’s head. Sparks showered him as Icar grunted, plunging his weapon deep into the Darkened Dawn’s stomach. 
        Sibier blinked, dumbfounded. King Icar roughly grabbed his shoulder, lifting Siber back to his feet. When had he fallen to his knees?  </Sibier> “Come on kid! Burn the blasted food!”
        He nodded, shivering. Sibier couldn’t seem to get those haunting eyes out of his mind, but he definitely had not forgotten Ilyian. He saw his brother huddled somewhere, tears welling in his confused eyes. Crying for some moss. Crying to see his older brother. Crying to be safe. And that image ignited the bonfire of determination in Sibier. Nothing was getting to his brother. Nothing. 
        Not today. Not now.
        Not ever.
        King Icar whistled, raising his sword high in the air. </Sibier> “Valiant II, protect this kid!”
        For the first time, Sibier noticed the elite task force barrelling through the Darkened Dawn, their strikes precise and calculated. They tore through the opposing army, opening up a small passageway to more bags of food. This was his chance — he held the torch high above his head. 
        </Sibier> “For Ilyian!” he screamed. 
        The heat licked his skin, as sweat poured down him like rain. By now, three of the bags were consumed in a roaring inferno, as he lit several more on fire. Sword fight rang out behind him as Valiant II, King Icar and Trent fought together to buy him time. [dc]
        Another bag of food caught fire. Then another. And another.
        Skies, they were doing it. He was destroying years worth of food for his community, but it needed to be done. He trusted Trent. This was how they were going to win. 
        This was how he was going to protect Ilyian. 
        Fingers slick with sweat, Sibier placed the fire against another sac of food. They were all aflame. 
        The heti roared with anger. And this time, Sibier mets its glare with fiery determination.
Not today. Not now.

For You, Mother
Chapter Thirty-Eight
























Trent ducked. 
        The heti’s fist flew over his head, as Trent backed away. He could feel the heat of the food burning, as sweat matted his hair. It was nothing compared to the raging hate inside of him. The urge to kill. The flaming desire to let it all out. 
Forget. Don’t feel. Rage.
He didn’t dare think about what would happen to the kingdom if he failed. He didn’t dare imagine what the heti would do to his family. He didn’t dare envision what it would do to his sisters… Heavens above. He tried squinting out an image of the heti tearing Sasha apart piece by piece, its devilish grin on its face. 
        No! NO! Don’t think. Don’t feel! Just fight!
        That was a pain he could not beat. A pain he could not kill — only ignore. He slammed his sword up, knocking a Darkened Dawn in front of the heti. The monster barely even slowly cut his way through. Skies. 
        He hated it. He leapt forwards, arcing his blade at the monster’s heels. It was a mistake. The heti sidestepped, its legs becoming like jelly in the way it twisted. Trent barely twisted, as it kicked him. It glanced at his shoulder, but his momentum sent him sprawling. Skies. 
        The heti would capitalize. He had to move. Hate. Anger. Just feel. 
        Sibier lit the last bag on fire, as the Heti suddenly paused, staring at the kid. Trent puffed, his chest heaving up and down as he readied his sword in front of him, scrambling to his toes. 
        His heart pounded in his chest, like a hammer striking against a drum, its pulse so loud in the silence of waiting. It drowned out the screaming cuts on his thighs, the drooling blood seeping down his arms, and the crying wounds scratching his mind. He would bid his patience. Time favored him. 
        With the Darkened Dawn’s tribute burned, the heti would turn against the Darkened Dawn in retaliation. At least, that was what he hoped. Why else would they risk their entire army to steal back food they didn’t need? Icar had confirmed this.
        The Heti snarled, suddenly lashing out. Trent jolted back, but the attack wasn’t intended for him — instead, the Heti’s palms closed around a Darkened Dawn’s throat. </Sibier> “You fools promised us food. Now I will have our retribution for your lies.”[dd][de]
Trent scampered away, feeling the hate simmer in his stomach… but he turned it aside. He no longer needed to keep the Heti busy. Now, it would do the dirty work for him: destroying the Darkened Dawn. Then, he would kill it. Easy. A fool's work.
He didn’t want to face the truth.
        He felt his muscles ripple. His fingers clutch in rage, as his eyes narrowed. He wanted to kill the heti now — it didn’t matter that he didn’t know how, or even that it was currently his greatest asset — he wanted it dead. He needed something to stoke the flames of his rage. He couldn’t go back to thinking. He couldn’t.
        Trent’s eyes locked with King Icar’s.
        I will kill that man. 
Shoving a Darkened Dawn to the side, Trent fought his way to that idiot of a man. He had to wait to kill the Heti, but he would kill the king now. He had waited long enough. And, skies, the middle of battle was the perfect time for someone to disappear. The rest of his family would be safe from Icar’s threats. For mother. 
        King Icar fought with Valiant II, staying in the center with relative safety. That coward, Trent growled. They were making their way back to the exit, completely abandoning the kid after he saved all their lives. Trent plowed forwards.
        It didn’t matter. Trent would get his revenge. 
        Trent dodged a swing, ramming his knee into the man who dared attack him. The man crumpled over as Trent followed up swinging. His sword pierced the man’s gut. That will teach him. Ingrate. 
        King Icar slipped through the exit, entering the fresh air. Bursting forward, Trent trailed close behind, his eyes squinting at the moonlight. Blood squished underneath his boots as he stepped on the soggy mud: before him littered the bodies of the Darkened Dawn — a graveyard. And in the midst of it all, was Icar: soon to join the fallen. Everyone else was long gone, fading in the distance. Karia was smarter than to stay. 
        A few months ago, Trent would have cared. But now all that mattered was his burning revenge. That hate, that anger, that passion. Anything to keep him from feeling. Anything to stop him from thinking about who he was. Who he had become. He had forgotten about the cloth in his pocket.
        I will kill that man. 
        </Sibier> “Icar!” Trent called out, his voice demanding. A challenge like that could not go ignored. 
        With his sword in his sheath, Icar looked over his shoulder, meeting Trent’s eyes. Starlight reflected off of the King’s too polished skin, his brown eyes cold and calculating. His lips drew taunt — a thin, disappointed line — musing with discontent. Then, he took another step, dismissing Trent like dirt. Not even worth the breath to speak too. 
        King Icar knew he controlled everything. He was a mastermind. He knew he controlled Trent. He was right. 
        Most of the time.
        But the High Executioner clenched his fist, his blood-red sword glistening. I’m not Trent, you buffoon.
        This time, no armour was going to stop him from sinking his blade straight through King Icar’s heart. Nothing was going to stop him. Nothing. All his pain stemmed from Icar — the reason for all his suffering. It was time he paid it back in full. 
        Kill him. The High Executioner smiled, welcoming the rage. The anger. The hate. The smile grew into a grin. Oh, I will. 
        Sheathing his sword, Trent elbowed aside a guard, striding straight for Icar. No one stopped him. Valliant II held their palms against the pommels, but none of them made a move. He was a general now. He ranked higher than them. 
        Skies, Icar, notice me already! He was practically on his toes, and the king didn’t even acknowledge him. Blast it. Growling, Trent grabbed Icar’s shoulder, whirling him around.
        Then punched the swine square in the jaw.
Eight swords ripped out of their sheaths, as Valliant II surrounded Trent, waiting for what would come next. Daring him to try again. Daring him to draw his sword. With only one hand, he stood no chance against eight. Eight lethal warriors. 
        Icar hit the ground, blood splashing up from the dirt. It splattered across his face, mixing with his sweat. He squared his jaw, as his gaze hardened. Impenetrable. A glare that only comes with ruling with absolute authority. A stare that left no room to question. 
        But now, the High Executioner dared to defy it. 
        </Karia> “You, Trent,” the king sneered, </Sibier> “are pathetic. Even with all your talent, it's a shame you can’t even figure out when you are beaten. You lost to me years ago. Accept it.”
        </It> “Then why am I not dead, tyrant?”
        </Sibier> “And why am I still alive?” Icar rose to his feet, wiping blood from off of his stained clothing. He didn’t shake. He didn’t falter. Shoulders back, head straight. Daring. Sure. Bold. </Lillian> “Go ahead. Try it: try to kill me.”
        Trent twitched, itching to draw his sword. The hate swelled within him, stinking with his breath. He waited, the venom stilling his blood. This was it. This was his moment. The time to avenge mother. 
        King Icar narrowed his eyes. </Lillian> “Then watch as the rest of your family is brutally murdered in front of you as you are dragged down to be tortured for the rest of your life. Is that what you would choose over your life of honor? Is defiance the choice your mother would have chosen for you if she knew it would cost her her life?”
        Icar pointed his finger, shoving it against Trent’s chest. </Selean> “Don’t be so naive. You. Are. My. Pawn.”
        The High Executioner’s vein burst. </Sibier> “Go to the depths, you idiot!” 
        The fury had been unleashed. The hate, the rage, the anger. All unchained. All free. And it came roaring out of him as it snapped its dam and flooded everything in its path. 
Like the waves that crash against the shore, the High Executioner beat down on Icar. His sword screeched as he ripped it from its sheath, its arc glaring with moonlight. It shone with a memory’s light, tearing through the sky with the heat of rage. Icar killed his mother. 
        Skies, Icar had killed his mother. 
        He had killed the hope of the kingdom, his rebellion. Icar had even killed Trent. The High Executioner only hoped this would sting him as badly as it stung him. Heavens above, to the depths with Icar. 
        With breaking force, the High Executioner’s blade cracked against King Icar’s armour. Icar’s sword spiraled out of his hands, cutting into blood soaked dirt, as he stumbled to his knees. 
        For a second, fear shone on the king’s face, before quickly smothered with resolute confidence. 
        But the High Executioner grinned — tooth to tooth. He could feel Icar shivering beneath his skin. It alighted his passion, his fury, his hate. It was time he avenged the kingdom. It was time he avenged Trent.
        Biting dust, the High Executioner lifted his sword high. For Sasha. He smashed it against Icar’s helm. For Selean. The High Executioner gritted his teeth, bashing his sword against Icar’s stomach. Blood began to color steel. For father. 
        Mother. 
        He fought back tears, feeling their salty sting against his cheeks. He should have done this months ago. He should have never withheld, he should have listened to Karia, and he should have killed him then and there. That could not be undone. His mistakes could never be unraveled. The lives he killed — never restored. Trent could never come back. But the High Executioner could finish what a rebellion leader started. What a hero had started. What a man of hope, connectivity, and valor had begun. He could finish Trent’s legacy. 
        Growling, the High Executioner lifted his blade high in the air. </It> “Skies, forgive me.” With a final plunge, he snapped the sword through King Icar’s heart. For Sibier. It squelched with a sickening pop, the light from the king’s eyes fading. For Trent. 
        He blinked. For myself. 
        Valor II waited with swords drawn. They had known King Icar’s orders, yet, they waited. </Sibier> “Will you take us back to save the kid?”
        The High Executioner looked at the man who spoke, bloodlust shimmering in his eyes. His hand trembled as it held his shattered sword, staring down the man who just seemed to threaten him with an order, disguised as a question. How dare he question my authority? His missing hand loomed in his mind, burning with his rage. Sibier deserved the death waiting for him.  He didn’t wait to think. 
        Only felt. Anger. Hate. Passion.
        </Sibier> “The kid deserves to drown in the depths,” the High Executioner growled. 
        The guard nodded to the others, giving the silent sign. As one, Valiant II approached Trent, with weapons drawn. Eight against one. 
        The High Executioner didn’t back down. He was a legend. He was the man who killed King Icar. 
He was unkillable. 
In the corner of his vision, he saw Sibier stumble over bodies, hands clutching a bleeding wound. I will kill that man. 
The High Executioner leapt at Valiant II — thirsting to kill. Revenge would be his. 
I will kill that man.

Survive
Chapter Thirty-Nine
























He. Had. To. Survive. 
Sibier gasped for breath, shambling through a rotten graveyard. Behind him screams echoed like a chamber of haunting nightmares — none were escaping the heti’s wrath. The monster was slaughtering everyone. He closed his eyes, trying to pry the images from his mind. Flesh tearing, guts ripping, eyes popping… was that how Gilit had been? Skies.
        It was a miracle he escaped with only a gash to his stomach. Thank the stars. 
        Coughing blood, he squinted, pleading for the pain to go away. It would be so easy to lie down, to give up. To die. But he couldn’t. He needed to make sure Ilyian was safe. He needed to make sure his community was ok. He needed to survive. Heavens above, he was going to make it... or he was going to die trying. 
        Rubbing his eyes free of sweat, he focused on the jostling figures near the edge of the island. Fierce winds blasted against them as they huddled, crossing the small bridge as fast as they could. Sibier swallowed blood. With a storm like this — billowing winds, consuming fog, and pounding rain — the task would be near impossible. It would take time. Lots of it.
Hopefully enough to have Sibier catch up. And take Ilyian across the bridge with him. He winced, grabbing his side. He pulled away his hand, stained red. Skies, there was a lot of blood. Help me. Please.
        He closed his eyes, shunning the nightmares out of his mind. Yet, his fear laughed at him, clawing its way and rooting itself firmly in his shattered gut. He couldn’t unsee the heti’s blackened fingernails tear apart Ilyian. Its threats still echoed through him, repeating like an annoying eight-year old.
        Sibier wailed. That won’t happen. I won’t let it happen. Nothing will happen to Ilyian. Nothing will touch him, please, please! Panic corroded at his bones, as he took the next step. Then the next. Every footfall pounded in his chest, burning away at his body. He throbbed. All of him.
I will make it. I have to. I have to survive. 
        Still, the heti’s threat loomed like a thundercloud, its threat heavy and cold. Darker than the tendrils of fog swirling around him, nearly snaring him with chilly tangibility. We take what we wish, the monster had snickered. Your friends. Your family. 
Sibier clenched his fist. That won’t happen. He glanced at the sky, his tears wells of emotions. Please skies, don’t let it happen! His plea tasted like blood on his tongue — metallic and stale. Empty. 
        Had they abandoned him again? He coughed, stumbling. Forlorn by the heavens, already? After he sacrificed so much? It didn’t seem fair. 
        Another step. Then another. He was going to make it, but then what? How was he going to stop the heti? How were any of them going to stop the heti? His heart plunged as he knew the truth, but he didn’t dare face it. If not even the Darkened Dawn could kill it, how could he hope to? Even if he could be alert and ready, he didn’t even stand a chance, but now he was injured, barely footsteps ahead of death. He would be like ash to the heti: ready to be blown away. Ready to be forgotten.
But heavens above, he had to try. He had to. He had to survive — he had to win. 
        Ilyian depended on it. 
        The blur of people crossing the bridge slowly colalessed into indistinguishable figures, with Karia’s voice guiding them. Moonlight glittered through the storm clouds, as lightning shook the air. At least there was light to see. It could be worse. 
        But not that much worse.
        He coughed, feeling his vision shake. It had taken him nearly an hour to make it to them, his slow shuffling caking his shoes in other’s sticky flesh. His cheeks dried to an ashen gray, his eyes becoming holes to an abyss of worry. He had to protect Ilyian. 
His eyes darted among figures of the crowd. Karia swept around the group, leading with natural ease. He picked her out readily. Besides her, the wind whipped at Lillian’s torrential hair, as she pulled someone to their feet. Terit wrapped a bandage around his arm, teeth grinding together as people streamed by him. Sibier blinked. He had survived? 
        He was too tired to feel grateful at the miracle. 
By now, everyone but the warriors had crossed the bridge, a mix of Sibier’s community and the royal guard. For once, their fear unified them to work together: they had a common enemy. A heti. Who they were no longer mattered — only where they were. Everyone needed to cross that bridge. 
        Sibier’s eye caught Selean’s. Her lip quivered but she held her chin high, fighting back tears. Holding her sword in one hand, he had Ilyian’s palm in her other, keeping him close as he scraped the moss on the ground. That little buffoon, Sibier laughed halfheartedly. He is safe. 
        A surge of relief overcame Sibier as he kept eye contact. He didn’t dare look away, for fear he would never see them again. Skies, any moment could be his last. But he would have this one.
Thank you. Heavens above, thank you! He saw beneath all Selean’s doubt and her worry, seeing something else so clearly: she shined like a star. Determination. Compassion. Hope. She was bright with all of it, beautifully luminous. He admired that, feeling it deeply resonate within his soul. Skies, he admired her. 
        Ilyian was safe.
        With renewed effort, Sibier ran to them. He tripped, falling on his stomach, but the pain was nothing compared to his joy. He had made it. He was here. He had survived. 
        And the heti… 
        He swallowed, the panic enveloping him again. Its jaws were wide, and no matter where he turned to hide, it’s teeth closed around. He felt Selean’s fear. He felt Terit’s grimaced pain, and Karia’s anxiety to get them all across the island. But none of them had Sibier’s terror. None of them knew what it was like to hear the heti’s throat grinding as it spoke, and none of them knew what it was like to brace against its blows. 
        None of them knew what it was like to have it as a part of you. 
        In this, Sibier was forlorn. 
        And he preferred it to stay that way. His imagination was painfully present in his mind, Ilyian’s screeching…
        No. It would not come to that. Please, don’t let it come to that.  He watched as Ilyian rubbed his finger in the moss, before popping in his mouth. The kid gave a delighted squeal, stomping up and down with his feet. Somehow, Ily managed to find simple happiness despite all the taunt anxiety around him, despite the fierce storm threatening to whisk him away, despite the heti, despite the bodies... Ilyian was still Ily — joyful. 
        Sibier gave a faint smile. Selean smiled back. Bless her heart. He needed that. Sibier blinked — he needed a lot of things: to survive, to beat the heti and to see Ilyian, but skies, he needed that. 
        Lillian placed her hand on Sibier’s shoulder, lifting him from his crouched position. Sibier met her caring gaze, one he had seen his mother wear before. His heart pounded in his chest, as tears dropped from eyes. 
        </It> “Oh, Sibier, we need — ”
        Sibier hugged her, clinging tightly as he shivered. Those were words his mother would have said if she was here. And he would do everything to make her proud; he would do everything to fulfill the promise he had made to her. He squeezed harder, unwilling to let go. Lillian wrapped her arms around him, gently and caring. 
        </Sibier> “Thank you,” Sibier choked, his words nearly indecipherable as both tears and blood clotted his throat. </Selean> “Thank you.”
        Lillian nodded, as she calmed Sibier, feeling him shake underneath her hold. </Sibier> “Thank goodness you're here,” she whispered. </The High Executioner> “Selean was really worried about you, and she promised to take good care of Ilyian until you returned. Let me tend to your gash. We need to dress those wounds.”
        Reluctantly, Sibier pulled away, feeling the warmth of his memories — remembering when his mother held him just the same. He wiped tears from his eyes, still quivering with fear. But he remembered his promise. He remembered his parents. And he remembered who they were to him. 
        No matter what, the heti wasn’t going anywhere near Ilyian. Sibier sniffed. Heavens above, he wouldn’t allow it.
        Lillian led Sibier to where they had a small bundle of cloth, as she set to work cleaning the wound. Every second he spent there was excruciating. He wanted to be with Selean and Ilyian. He wanted to make sure that they were ok. He wanted to hold his little brother’s hand and whisper to him everything was going to be alright.
        But first, he needed to survive. 
        After what felt like an eternity, Lillian finished. The last of the warriors were crossing the bridge, leaving the four of them: Lillian, Karia, Terit and Sibier. His friends. Selean waited on the other side, calling out to him, but her voice was lost to the wind. Her plea, however, was not. 
        Together, the four of them crossed the bridge. The harsh winds plowed into them with unbelievable force, its torrents washing away their blood. Dirt slid off his skin, rubbing him raw as the bandage clung painfully to his skin. He shielded his eyes. The wind, the water — nature — could not wash away his fear. His terror still whispered in the back of his mind, haunting.
        His throat dry with worry and skin red and raw, Sibier fumbled onto the other island. Ilyian ran to him, jumping onto his leg as he hummed with joy. Bless his heart.
Sibier smiled, ever aware of the weight of the threat on his shoulders. But he was here with the people that mattered and Ilyian was safe. Skies, Ilyian was safe. His stomach flopped. He only had to make sure it stayed that way. 
Eyes wet, Sibier pulled Selean close, feeling the heat of her breath against his cheeks. Feeling her warm compassion, that spark of life and hope she always carried. He kissed her.
</The High Executioner> “Thank you,” he whispered. </The High Executioner> “Thank you for watching over him.”
Selean blushed, wrapping her arms around him. She too shivered with fear, doing her best to hide it behind her emerald eyes.  </The High Executioner> “Thank you for coming back.”
Sibier pulled away the hug, despite wanting the feeling to last forever but he had to do something first. He had to make sure of one thing: he had to make sure his promise was kept. 
Holding Selean’s shoulders, he stared squarely into her eyes, as tears rolled down his face. </Karia> “Promise me one thing,” Sibier sobbed, unable to control his emotion. </Sibier> “Promise that no matter what happens to me, that you will look after him. That you will keep him safe.”
Selean’s eyes widened. </Sibier> “What do you mean?” she stuttered. 
</Sibier> “Promise me,” Sibier repeated, begging. </Selean> “Please, promise me that you will do it!”
Selean shuddered, as Sibier’s heart beat to a crescendo. He could feel it in his ears, his brain, his head as he waited for an answer. The heti’s threat loud... </Selean> “Please.”
Selean nodded, her voice losing words. Finally, she breathed out an answer. </Selean> “I will.”
________________
I Am Sorry
Chapter Forty
























The wind howled in his ears unapologetically. 
        Sibier let his fingers skit across Selean’s skin as he pulled away. A fire burned in his chest, fighting the fear of the heti. He knew it would come, but for now peace blossomed in his chest. Selean would watch over Ilyian if something went wrong… Sibier was almost certain something would.
        He could taste it like rotten moss — pungent, and impossible to rid of. It stuck to his bones like a disease.
        He met Selean’s eyes, searching the depths of her soul. She didn’t want him to let go; he could see it in her. She didn’t want to say those words, but Sibier needed to hear it. He felt his heartbeat in his chest. </The High Executioner> “Thank you,” he whispered. 
        Selean only nodded, tears pooling in her eyes. Ilyian — finally falling off of Sibier’s leg — grunted as he scrambled over to her, clawing for Selean’s hand. 
        Sibier smiled, rueful. He could barely keep his cheeks dry as Selean reached down, holding Ilyian’s hand. The kid grinned as though he had just been given all the moss in the kingdom. He plopped his thumb into his mouth. 
Exhausted, Sibier fell to his knees, his breathing ragged. He needed to rest… his eyes drooped closed. The darkness felt so real, so complete. He reached out  to it, ready to accept it. Ready to move on… he hurt. But the darkness was freedom. He was so tired. 
        Selean sat, wrapping her arm around Sibier’s shoulders, resting her head against him. He hummed, feeling the peace inside of him grow. He slid his hand down the back of her head, gently holding her. She was a light that dispelled the darkness. 
        He couldn’t give in yet. Sibier had to survive. For Ily. For Selean. 
        </Sibier> “Sibier!” The word shattered the moment, carrying with it soul-crushing hate. It floated with dark tendrils, a challenge that could not be ignored. Trent had come. Trent had arrived. 
        Selean’s face darkened as Sibier whirled around. On the other side of the bridge, stood a ragged, bloody man. A single hand. A single black glove. But two bloodthirsty eyes. 
        They were like pits of loathing, burning with an unquenchable fire. Sibier could feel the heat despite the chilling wind and frosty air. Blood caked the High Executioner’s skin, but Sibier only had a lump in his throat. Those eyes. 
        Skies, those eyes. 
        Goosebumps riddled Sibier’s skin, as he shuddered. His blade shrieked as he drew it out of his sheath. He had heard the challenge. </Sibier> “What do you want?”
        Sibier could almost feel Selean’s anxiety behind him. Karia, however, narrowed her eyes. </Sibier> “Trent, your men are here. Where is the heti?”
        Coughing blood, Trent stumbled onto the bridge. The fool was worn and torn, but his eyes showed no sign of losing any vigor. He pointed his sword at Sibier, his hair battering against his head. He looked as though he had crawled out of his own grave, rebirthed in vengeance. </Sibier> “Step onto the bridge, kid. This is between me and you.”
        Selean covered her mouth, eyes wide. Sibier squeezed her hand, turning to her briefly. </Sibier> “Watch after him,” he whispered, nodding to Ilyian. He wished his touch could linger, as he took a deep breath in. He doubted he would get to touch them again. 
He faced Trent. Gulping, he stepped onto the bridge, sword in hand. Behind him Karia, Terit, Lillian and Selean watched grim faced, wondering if they should intervene. None knew. And none dared to.
        The air hung tight between Trent and Sibier. Neither spoke as the storm howled around them, its chill biting into their skin. Sibier rolled his blade in his hand, never bowing underneath the High Executioner’s intimidation. Never wavering. Never forgetting his parent’s promise. He never would.
        He could still feel Selean’s arm around him. It gave him strength. This is for her. This is for Ilyian. 
        </Sibier> “You killed my mother,” Sibier hissed. His tone, too, echoed dangerously. </Selean> “You killed my father.”
        Trent spat. </Sibier> “No, you blasted idiot. I saved you — I couldn’t have saved them.”
        Sibier’s fury ignited like a bonfire. How could this man pretend to have saved me! Arrogant swine! </Sibier> “Liar! You killed without mercy, and you killed without thought.”
        Trent’s face contorted, rage leaking from his wounds like blood. </Sibier> “I didn’t get the choice to kill with mercy.” He clenched his fist, slamming his hilt into his side. Blood burst into the wind, splattering his billowing coat. </Selean> “I didn’t get the choice to hide with my family, to act like everything will be ok. I didn’t get the choice but to kill. I saved you: hoping you could be better. I was wrong. I should have killed you and your brother the first time I saw you — I should have killed hope then.”
        Growling, Sibier planted his feet. </Selean> “No one touches Ilyian.”
        Trent narrowed his eyes. </Selean> “You have brought my family inescapable anguish. Now it is time for me to do the same.”
        Selean gasped, and it ignited Sibier’s rage. How could this monster be her brother? He clenched his jaw. </Sibier> “You know nothing about your family.”
        Karia blinked. </Selean> “Sibier, you idiot…”
        Trent bellowed, streaking forward. He ripped through the space between them, wrapping momentum into his strike. 
        Skies. His heart crashed against his chest as Sibier barely raised up his cursed arm. With a shriek of pain, he blocked the blow, screaming. His feet slid towards the edge of the bridge. Heavens above. 
        Trent slid past him, withdrawing his blade quickly to keep it from snapping. After fighting with the Heti, he wasn’t dumb enough to fall for that trick. Sibier wished he was. Skies, he prayed for it.
        Diving back to the middle of the bridge, Sibier rolled to his feet, panting. He rubbed water off of his mouth as he gaped at Trent. Behind him, he saw Selean pull Ilyian close to her, the child crying. Skies, that swine, Sibier cursed Trent. He noticed Karia, Terit and Lillian had drawn their blades. 
        This wasn’t just his fight.
        Trent squared his jaw — a bull ready to charge. His gaze snapped just above Sibier, huffing yet still. What is he looking at? Fear dawned on Karia, scrunching up her face as she raised her blade. She didn’t move.
But Terit did. The vagrant charged forward, rocketing across slippery cobblestone. 
Sibier risked a glance behind him. 
        And found a heti. An angry heti.
        Heavens above. Its blade was already outstretched, arcing at Sibier. Spinning, he rolled on his heels, panicked as he tried to avoid the attack. He was too late. Skies, the Heti’s flexibility was unparalleled as it parallelled Sibier’s attempt to dodge.
Sword hit sword. Terit groaned as he barely intercepted the blow, knocked off balance. His momentum propelled him forwards as he crashed into the heti, throwing them both to the ground. 
        Sibier scrambled in the downpour, rushing to help Terit. 
Yet, with eerie agility, the heti threw Terit underneath him, whirling his sword around its fingers. With finality, the Heti plunged its metal-like fingers straight through Terit’s heart. 
Terit had sacrificed himself after all.
Sibier skidded to a halt, screaming. Mouth agape, Terit’s face held a pure expression of terror — a death like Yorin’s.  He swallowed tears, feeling fury burn in his chest. Feeling the fear gnaw at him. How could he stop this thing? It had dismantled Terit with ease, and now it stood meters away from Ilyian. 
Blast it! </Sibier> “TO THE DEPTHS WITH YOU!” Sibier yelled. Lightning flashed behind him, as the wind roared in his ears, trying to fling him off the bridge. Sibier wouldn't have it. 
The Heti sneered, its snarl grinning from ear to ear. </Sibier> “You’re next.”
Sibier twitched, glaring at the monster. He felt words catch in his throat, his fear holding the reins. He was going to die. Skies, he was going to die. They were all going to die. 
But that anger. It had killed Terit. His heart pounded in his chest. His legs shook. He clenched the pommel of his sword tight. His lips quivered. 
Rolling off of Terit’s body, the Heti bounded towards Sibier. He couldn’t move. Skies, how could you stop it? The thing was unkillable! 
Trent’s sword arced in front of Sibier, knocking the Heti’s blade away. Trent spun on his feet, his face grimaced as he spun as a tempest. </Selean> “Don’t think of this as saving you kid. I’m killing you later.”
Sibier shook, blinking away his shock. What am I doing! Standing here? Trent whirled around the Heti, unbelievably quick. Even though the Heti’s flexibility was unmatched, Trent’s skill was unparalleled. If any man could stand up to it, the High Executioner could.
Karia leapt, joining Trent in the battle. Lillian placed her hand on Sibier’s shoulder, looking into his eyes. </Selean> “Come on,” she urged, encouraging. </Selean> “Let's do this. Together.”
Sibier nodded, still shivering. He felt the stars shining, his parents watching him overhead. Waiting to see if he would keep his promise to them. Waiting to see if he would protect Ilyian. Waiting to see him fight. 
Skies, he would. 
For Terit. For Yorin. 
Selean nudged him, her freckles nearly unseeable with her flushed cheeks — just as scared as he was. Skies, she could barely hold her sword. </Selean> “For Ilyian,” she whispered. 
Those words hit Sibier harder than a tidal wave. This was it. Skies, this was it. He was Sibier Starling, and heavens above, this was for his little Ily. 
</Sibier> “FOR ILYIAN!” Sibier roared. 
He dove at the Heti, joining the fray. It was five to one. The heti spun, ducked, and absorbed hits, never once losing its frightful smile. It couldn’t die, and it knew it. It was having fun. 
Sibier sidestepped, jabbing at the monster. His blade hit the Heti in its stomach, causing it to fumble. Everytime it absorbed the blow, its flexibility plummeted as it grew heavy. Trent followed up with a crushing slam, knocking the Heti to its knees. 
They were winning. The heti’s sword fell from its fingers. 
Heavens above. They were winning. 
But you couldn’t win against something that couldn’t lose. Suddenly, the heti spun, throwing Trent backwards. It caught Karia’s strike with its palm, bending her blade as it slammed its knee against her stomach. She dropped to the ground. Sibier threw a fist, but it ducked, spinning away from Selean’s swing. She stumbled backwards, barely keeping her blade from cutting off Sibier's fist. She slipped, crashing onto her arm. 
With cruel efficiency, the Heti wrapped its arm around Lillian’s throat. </Selean> “You shouldn’t have burned the food,” it seethed. Sibier yelled, leaping forwards but he was too late. Lillian’s fingers pried at the heti’s arm, gasping for breath as the heti crushed her windpipe[df]. Her eyes rolled to the back of her head. 
Dead. 
Tears streamed down Sibier’s cheeks as he roared, cascading into a ravenous fury. He hit as he remembered Lillian’s motherly concern for him. He stabbed as he remembered Lillian’s uplifting care. He kicked as he remembered her lifting him back to his feet. 
Lillian didn’t deserve to die. Skies, she deserved much more. 
Terit didn’t deserve to die. Skies, he deserved much more.
Tears poured down Sibier’s cheeks as he screamed at the Heti. </Selean> “You will plunge to the depths for this!”
The heti grinned, catching Sibier’s fist. His breath stunk as he got close to Sibier’s face, his words a whisper but still fiercer than the storm. </Selean> “No, I own all of you. You shouldn’t have burned the food slave.” Sibier grimaced against the heti’s strength, fighting to maintain his ground. He had to. He couldn’t fail. For Ilyian. For Ilyian. 
Skies, I can’t fail. For Ilyian. For Ilyian. 
He pushed with everything he had, his face burning red with exertion. Everything he had he mustered, fighting against the heti. For Werrin. For Yorin. Terit. Lillian.
Mom. Dad. 
Heavens above, help me. 
But this fight Sibier wasn’t destined to win. The heti swung its leg, kicking out Sibier’s feet. He fell to the ground, his head slamming against the wet cobblestone. He felt blood. Warmth against the bitter cold. 
Blackness. 
He fought it off, gritting his teeth. Keep fighting, he growled at himself. His wound in his stomach flared up, painfully gnawing at him. Ignore it. Get up. Weakness enveloped him like the ocean was drowning him; exhaustion welling up in him like a plague. Come on! Get up!
The Heti picked up Sibier’s blade off of the ground. He was hardly aware he dropped it. The monster placed its blackened foot against Sibier’s chest, crushing any remaining breath left in him. </Selean> “Rest assured that tonight your brother dies at my hands.”
The heti raised Sibier’s blade high into the air. 
Sibier swallowed, eyes wide. Skies. Not today.
Not now.

Repentance
Chapter Forty-One
























Trent slid off the bridge. 
        Heavens above. 
        Growling, he caught his sword in the crack, dangling dangerously over the thousand foot drop above the torrential waters below. The storm howled in his ears as it beat at him, tempting him to let go, to trust in it. But, blast it, he didn’t trust anything anymore. 
        The High Executioner hardened his jaw. Skies, nothing was going to kill him that easily. Groaning, he hauled himself back onto the bridge, his sword bending with the pressure. Not a good sign. 
        It didn’t matter. He was going to kill that heti regardless. Then, burning skies, he was going to kill that rotten kid after too. It was all he felt: bloodlusting fury. Revenge. 
        It had promised to swallow up all his pain, and that had been a deal Trent could not have turned away. Now, Trent was gone and only the High Executioner remained. 
        Lifting his waist onto the platform, Trent glared at the heti. It’s sword was raised high above its head, with Sibier gurgling underneath its heel. Serves him right.
        But the High Executioner’s hate burned deeper than that. Sibier was his to kill, and it was his revenge that needed sating. Nothing else could do it for him. Skies, he wasn’t going to let anything else kill Sibier for him. 
        Plowing to his feet, the High Executioner roared. His boots pounded against the bridge, hammering with the beat of his heart. He charged the heti. Heavens above, I’m not going to make it in time. One step. Then the next. Another. 
The sword fell faster. And harder.
        Sibier reached up, and...

Not now. 
        Not today. 
        Skies, help me. 
        Something snapped. Sibier felt it echo down to his very soul, feeling power surging in him. His skin felt tight, as his entire body grew hot, burning in him. He screamed, his eyes fiery with passion, ignited with resolve. 
        For Ilyian. For Terit. For mom. For dad. For Werrin, Shem, Lillian. 
        For Selean. 
        The conviction swelled in him. Goosebumps shot down his skin, his heart pounding. He screamed, shaking with emotion. Shaking with strength. Shaking with power. 
        He didn’t hurt. This was his moment. Light pierced through the clouds, slamming into him like a godly blessing. He relished in it. He closed his eyes, feeling. Enveloped in it. Surviving. 
        His eyes burst open. His veins popped underneath his skin, their flaming heat a crescendo. Skies, he was a survivor. 
        He was Sibier Starling[dg]. 
        For Ilyian.
        He caught the blade. Growling.

⧫        ⧫


Sibier caught it. 
        Trent skidded to a halt, terrified of the kid. This was… wrong. Skies. Sibier’s body trembled with unholy fervor, rattling like pebbles thrown about in an earthquake. Sibier shone purple like a glowstone burns bright when superheated, his skin translucent to the elixir within his blood. Luminous like the sun. And those… those eyes. Fiery with hope, blazing with determination, and unquenchable by fear. His eyes radiated with it. Brilliant, unquenchable. Unbreakable. Pure. Frightening. 
Selean charged the Heti, blade high in the air. Suddenly — as he saw her face stretch with rage — something shattered in Trent. He had made a promise, hadn’t he? A promise to his family. To protect them. To ensure their safety. And now, here was his youngest sister, taking on the most dangerous being in the entirety of the kingdom, whipped about in a storm. While he stood here. Some older brother I am. 
        Yet heavens above, he would keep his promise. Skies, he would kill the heti. He would get his revenge against Sibier, but above all, his sister was going to stay safe. Nothing else was going to happen to his family. 
        The memory of his mother’s head falling to the floor haunted him.
        Nothing else was going to happen to his family. Ever.
Raging, Trent grabbed Selean’s arm, tearing her away from her strike. He threw her to the ground, yelling. </Ilyian> “Run you fool! Get away!”
        Selean set her jaw, resolute. </her> “I’m not leaving Sibier!”
        Growling, Trent shoved her away, despite her clawing at him. He ripped her blade from her hands, throwing it onto the island. </Ilyian> “Leave! Skies! Do it now!”
        Selean scrambled after her sword, as Trent’s heart thumped in his chest. So much heat! So much anger, rage, fury! It hurt. Burning skies, it all hurt so bad. The anger, the grief — the passion. They all welled up within him swirling like a tempest, breaking everything and anything. Too much pain. It was easier not to think, not to feel. 
        Just to be the High Executioner. 
        No. He couldn’t. Skies, he couldn’t become the High Executioner anymore. He had made a promise, and he had almost failed. Heavens above, he had failed his mother. Tears dripped down his cheeks, as he turned back to the heti and Sibier. The two struggled, rooted in a standstill, the Heti grinning as it pressed its sword closer and closer to Sibier’s throat. Yet the kid flared with zealous courage, pressing back against the heti — right next to the edge. 
With a thousand foot drop.
        A sword couldn’t cut the Heti’s skin, but, heavens above, it could drown in the depths. All he had to do was tackle it off the edge.
He could make his mother proud. He could do it for Sasha and he would do it for Selean. This was his chance — skies, this was his chance to redeem himself. His last moment of blazing glory. His opportunity to be Trent. His opportunity to die as Trent. 
To die as a rebellion leader. To die as the person he had once been. To die. To die as himself.
        He blinked away tears as he sprinted towards the heti. For the first time in months, he smiled with the thoughts of his family, once again with a future. With no more Icar. With no more heti terrorizing them, and with no more High Executioner to call brother. Skies, what have I been doing?
        He felt the pain. Waves and waves of it. But now, he realized there was also another emotion he had been blocking out: love. Peace. The things he needed to be Trent, the things he needed to be able to fulfill his promise. This was who he was. This is who he could be again. This is who I will be again. A brother. A leader. A man of hope. 
        He could beat the pain. He had to. The grief, the agony, the internal biting. He roared as he closed the distance to the heti, arms outstretched. Ready to tackle it. Ready to send him and it plunging to the depths. Tears soaked his skin, but he didn’t fight them. They were a part of who he was, and he didn’t have to block that out. Skies, he hated it, but he hated the High Executioner more. 
        </I> “For you, Selean.” Ten feet. 
</I> “For you, Sasha.” Nine feet. 
</Karia> “For you, mom. Dad.” Five feet. 
Trent took in a deep breath, leaping with the tips of his toes, his heart nearly breaking free of his chest. This was it. 
</Sibier> “For you, Trent.” 
Tears seeped into his skin, as he took the final steps to tackle the Heti off the cliff. Together they would fall. And together, they would be forgotten. 
        Karia caught him, throwing Trent to the side. Her eyes were soaked, red from crying. Her hair, although choactic, was still beautiful and once again, Trent felt. Love. He felt love. 
        He had forgotten about that. 
        Karia wore a single black glove on her left hand. Trent wore the other on his only hand. They had been connected once back when he had never known the High Executioner. And once again, he felt that connection. He felt that want to be better for her, to make her proud. At one point, they had even discussed marriage. Trent sobbed as his shoulder slammed against the bridge, wishing he could have those days again.
Karia nodded to him, turning to the heti and charging. Sibier struggled with it, barely holding onto the sword, but keeping the monster rooted in place. Yet, even with all the noise of howling winds, and even though Karia wasn’t even looking at him, Trent could hear her mumbled words. </Sibier> “Trent, I still love you. I’ve always had.”
        She leapt, wrapping her arms around the heti, and sending them both tumbling over the edge and falling thousands of feet. Trent’s heart fell further.
        The pain. Skies the pain. The grief, the anguish, the regret. He couldn’t think about it. Heavens above, it was too much. All too consuming. His fingers clawed at his head, his breath ripped away from him. He couldn’t do it. He couldn’t do it. Skies, he couldn’t. Remain Trent, he pleaded with himself, begging. Embrace the pain. 
But he couldn’t. Heavens above, he couldn’t. He couldn’t keep it out. He couldn’t avoid it. He couldn’t. Not when Karia was that pain. He couldn’t keep the High Executioner away. After all, Trent was dead. His eyes locked with Sibier’s, and his passion exploded. He didn’t feel anything else. No sympathy. No remorse. Only anger.
        Anger, red and bright. Seething. Bloodthirsty and hateful. In his heart, there was only anger, smothering and killing every other emotion.
He was going to kill that man.

Joining the Stars Above
Chapter Forty-Two
























Sibier coughed. 
        He fell to his knees, trembling. Trembling with deep gratitude. Heavens above, he was alive. Thank you. He shook as he continued to cough, squinting out droplets of blood. Every inch of his skin burned as though it had been set ablaze, his heart squirming as purple elixir slurred around it. 
        He heaved. Whatever he had just done, Sibier didn’t think he would be able to survive it again. His body felt close to tearing, ripping down the center and letting all the purple elixir drain from him. But here he was, alive. And Ilyian was unhurt. 
        </Icar> “Thank you,” he muttered, words rasping. 
        Headache. The world seemed to spin, the howling of the wind blowing from every direction. It couldn’t do that could it? He felt his stomach roll around, as if a stone that couldn’t decide which way to fall. He blinked, trying to clear his vision, but after the blinding clarity from before, everything seemed smudged, dull even. 
        But his relief was profound. Ilyian was alive. The heti was gone. They were safe. Thank you. He had kept his promise to his parents, and he had kept his promise to himself. 
        He wiped tears from his eyes, remembering his mom and dad. Finally, he felt as though he could let them go. Yorin, Terit. With the glittering of stars above, Sibier could almost feel them smiling down on him. More tears wetted his cheeks, as he choked on emotion. Surely, they earned a place among the heavens.
Lillian, Werrin, Karia. A rueful smile warmed Sibier’s lips as he remembered their distinct kindness to him. They had good souls — they were people who cared about the kingdom around them. Even though they may have covered it underneath their armour or hardened personna, he had felt each of their kindly grace underneath. They were heroes. Martyrs for a better life, and maybe a life Sibier would get to raise Ilyian to. He glanced up at the stars, looking for them among the cosmos. </I> “Thank you.” Tears rolled down his face, like a cascading spring. </I> “Thank you.”
The serenity dropped cold.
 A heavy boot broke Sibier’s mourning. His eyes drifted up, as the figure in front of him melted from blurry images into sharp lines. In front of him towered the High Executioner. 
Blade outstretched. Eyes dripping with rage. Bloody cuts and scrapes scaring him with hate. He glared down like a beacon of fire, his teeth curved in a wolf-like snarl. The scent of fury was so strong, Sibier felt it curl around his neck like a noose. 
Sibier swallowed. Maybe Ilyian wasn’t yet safe after all.
In the corner of his eye, he saw Selean bound towards them. His heart pounded in his chest, as Sibier realized the inevitable. This was her brother. Fear was written on her face plainer than day as she tugged her sword against the cobblestones. Sibier met her wide green eyes with his weary, broken ones. 
He felt his heart snap. No matter what, Selean was going to lose. Lose her brother or her friend, but she was going to lose. Sibier sobbed, shakingly climbing to his feet. 
He only hoped Ilyian wouldn’t have to lose too. [dh]

⧫        ⧫


The High Executioner tightened his grip around Karia’s lost blade.
        To the depths with the stars. To the depths with this kingdom, and to the depths with Sibier. Skies, he wanted to kill it all. The fury, the anger. It was all he had left. 
        His boots fell heavy across the cobblestone. Thud. Thud. Veins popped as he craned his neck, never taking his eyes off his victim. Revenge. He needed revenge. 
        He lifted his sword. He heard Selean shriek. It didn’t even stir him. </she> “No! Stop,” she cried. 
        The High Executioner frowned. Why did he ever listen to such a pesty whiner? Breathing in, he felt his shoulders rise with rage. It carried him up, lifted him. Then, with a roar, he attacked. 
        He slammed his sword down, as Sibier spun on his heels. The High Executioner’s sword bashed against cobblestone, sparks flying. He growled. Idiot. 
        Siber reached down, palming the heti’s blade. His hair matted against his forehead, as he winced, puffing. Dare the blasted kid think he can beat me? I’ll kill him for that too. Idiot.
        The High Executioner plowed forwards with crushing momentum, his strikes blasting against Sibier’s rough defense. A blow, then another, and another. More. MORE. Kill him. 
Sibier stumbled back on his heels as the High Executioner released his onslaught of fury. There was no thought. There was no emotion. Only anger. 
        Sibier fell to the ground, eyes wide. His blade was bent. 
        Triumphant, the High Executioner dwarfed Sibier, sword raised high. His eyes met Seleans, a few feet away, kneeling and crying. Ilyian tugged on her arm, awfully silent.
        Trent held those eyes. Full of misery, sorrow — fear. But Trent no longer felt any of that, instead only his smoldering anger, passion — rage. </an oppertunist> “Don’t do this please,” Selean sobbed. </aw]or soul> “I love him like I love you.”
        The High Executioner hardened his jaw, but the blade wavered in his hand. There was pain underneath, he couldn’t open up to it. He couldn't do it. Accept the anger, the rage. Just fight. Don’t feel. 
        Kill him.
        He narrowed his eyes, glaring at his sister. </Sibier> “Don’t tell me what to do!” The High Executioner screamed. Burying all his feelings, the High Executioner thrust the sword down. With all the hate, passion, anger. Fury. All the years of pent up frustration, of listening to King Icar, the blasted years of starvation. After all the agony of losing his parents years ago, after all the pain of watching friends die by his side, after all the sorrow of betraying Karia — someone he had onced loved. Heavens above, blast it all. He wouldn’t even flinch as he drained the last of Sibier’s blood. 
        He missed.
        Sibier rolled, kicking out the High Executioner’s feet. Crashing hard onto the cobblestones, he spat, catching his blade. A few yards away, Sibier clambered to his feet, holding his bent blade wardingley. He still tried. The buffoon. 
        There was a hint of respect inside Trent: Sibier never lost his resolve. His conviction.
Wiping blood from his lip, the High Executioner planted his feet beneath him. Here is a fool who thinks he can stand up to me. Here is a fool who thinks he understands what he fights for. Here is a fool who still believes. The High Executioner grinned crookedly. It was going to feel so good to break him.  </Sibier> “You think you know hope, Sibier, but you don’t. You’ve never had an inkling of what hope is: it's not uplifting.”
Sibier gritted his teeth. He met the High Executioner’s eyes. </I> “Leave us alone.”
The High Executioner chuckled, swinging. Sibier ducked. </the “ messias ”> “Hope tells you to get up so it can knock you down.”
He jabbed at Sibier, his sword cutting a thin layer of skin. </Sibier> “Hope promises things are better to come, but only brings despair.”
He slammed his weapon against Sibier’s cursed arm, throwing the kid back on the ground. </Yorin> “Hope asks you to act for tomorrow, but it only robs you of today.”
Sibier tried to spin, but the High Executioner kicked the kid’s head. Something broke. Behind, Selean’s tears were drowning in the storm. His sister — no, Trent’s sister — pulled on his ripped sleeve. Blast her. In a brutal dismissal, he backhanded her, throwing her to the ground. Blood spilled from her lips. Serves her right. 
Dropping his sword, the High Executioner sniffed as he lifted Sibier up by his collar, nearly choking him. He brought his face up close, his breath wafting over Sibier’s bloodied face. </Sibier> “Trust me, you’ve never known how much hope can hurt.”
Sibier tried to punch the High Executioner, but he was faster, throwing the kid back on the ground. Bones snapped, as Sibier breathed weakly. One of his eyes had swollen shut, but his fingers closed tight around the pommel of the sword. He hadn’t yet given up. The kid never would.
But the High Executioner had enough. With a swift lunge, he grabbed Karia’s old sword, leaping. Anger. Rage. All in the name of his revenge. His blade tore through Sibier’s gut without emotion, without thought, with sympathy. Only heated passion. There was no satisfaction. Only fury.
The kid’s eyes went wide, blood pouring from him as he gaped at the wound. The High Executioner smirked. You can’t survive a wound like that.
Finished, the High Executioner stepped back, his fury kindled like a bonfire. Sibier’s death would be slow and painful. 
Perfect.

The stars were in the back of his head. 
        Come on, Sibier urged himself. Come on, get up! He couldn’t die right now. Skies, he was so close to protecting Ilyian, so close to getting the life he so desperately craved. So close! Get up!
        Pinpricks of light grew in the back of his mind, their white slowly consuming his vision. He felt the heat of tears dribbling down his cheeks — he was dying. This was it. His story ended here. 
        The boisterous cold of the storm faded away, as Sibier fought to keep his eyes open. So much pain. It all rolled up into one feeling, a forerunner to his demise. He choked on his own breath. He had failed Ilyian. The child would never get to know how much Sibier had truly loved for him, never understand all the sacrifice Sibier had given. 
        And Sibier would never be able to see Ilyian grow up. Skies, somebody needed to take care of him. Selean. His eyes darted back and forth, desperately trying to find her. Too see her one last time...
        Tears flowed down Sibier’s cheeks freely. He hoped Selean would take care of Ily, but he wished he could have done it with her. He wished he could have…
        Two arms wrapped around his neck. Clearing his eyes from his tears, he saw Selean’s dirty mop of hair as she hugged him. Sibier couldn’t stop sobbing, his strength fading with every breath. He clung to her warmth, weakly wrapping his arms around her. 
        This was it. This was the end. 
        Selean buried her head into his neck. </Yorin> “Don't go,” she begged, voice quivering. </Sibier> “Please, Sibier...”
        He choked, whiteness nearly clouding all his vision. But, thank the heavens, he could see her. Sibier embraced her tighter, desperate to keep himself from losing her. </the “ Messiah ”> “Selean,” he whispered, his words almost already a memory, </Unknown> “I’m scared.”
        Selean’s eyes squeezed shut, as her own tears splashed freely on Sibier’s shoulder. She clenched tighter, unable to speak. It was too hard. Her heart was ready to burst. </Unknown> “Its okay.”
        Sibier held tight, neither saying anything as time slipped past them. He wished this moment could last forever, as he blinked. Everything was white — whether his eyes were closed or not. He wouldn’t have much longer. There wasn’t much longer. His arms felt too heavy to move, glued to Selean. He pulled her even closer with the last of his strength, nearly broken. Nearly dead.
        But he couldn’t die here. Skies, I can’t die here. I have. To. Survie. For Ilyian. But every second he felt farther and farther away...
        </Unknown> “Promise me Selean that you will love Ilyian as I do.”
        Selean only cried, her breath ragged bundles of warmth on his skin. 
        </Unknown> “Please, Selean. Promise you will…” Sibier choked. </Unknown> “Please, just take care of my brother.”
        For just a second, Selean pulled her head up, her wide green eyes staring into Sibier’s. Bless her soul. </Unknown> “I will,” she breathed. 
        Sibier held the back of Selean’s head, feeling the last of his strength squeezed out of him. Ilyian would be well taken care of. He knew Selean would not fail: he had faith in her. Hope. 
        </Unknown> “I love you. Thank you, Selean.”
        Sibier slumped lifeless into her arms before Selean could mumble the words back. 
        </Unknown> “I love you too.”
Ilyian was without family.

Go to the Depths
Chapter Forty-Three
























Trent. My blasted name is Trent.
        The High Executioner squinted his eyes, blocking out any feeling. Remorse. I don’t need remorse. But it splintered his shield of anger, crawling into his heart. He couldn’t watch his sister hug a dying hero without feeling remorse. Especially when he had once been the hero dying. Especially when he had once been in that very position, so close to achieving his goal...
        Trent took off his glove — the one they had once shared. He let it fall to the ground. He remembered Karia’s arms wrapped around him as he struggled to stay awake. He remembered her tender words as he clung to her, fearing what would come next. He remembered the peace he had felt at her touch. Skies, what have I done? 
        Regret. Anguish. Tears. I have ruined everything. Maybe it would have been better off if he had died in Karia’s arms. Maybe then, she wouldn’t have drowned in the depths. Maybe then, Sibier could have grown into the hero Trent had failed to be. Maybe then, his family would have the safety they deserved. 
        Maybe then, his mother would still be alive. 
        Heavens above, the kingdom would be better off without me. 
        The wind whipped at Trent’s matted hair as he watched Sibier pull Selean closer. It broke Trent’s heart. That was his sister. Pain crashed into him like a tidal wave, guilt washing over him. He was drowning. He dropped to his knees, sobbing as his sword clattered out of his hand. Skies, it all hurts! What have I done! 
        Don’t think! Ignore it! Get up and fight! They deserved what they got! But those thoughts were overwhelmed by despair. It could not go away now, and it plagued his mind with its dark, crushing thoughts. Karia was dead. Mom was dead. Nothing he could do could change that. He had loved them. Skies, how he had loved them!
        And it might have well been his sword that had cut them both down. He was responsible for their deaths… and now he was taking something much worse away from Selean. Skies, what have I done! 
        Everything he had done as High Executioner hit him with a punch of regret. He had killed hundreds in a few months, delivering soul after soul to the trials. All in order to keep his family safe from a monster, but creating a monster in himself. A monster that killed someone his sister loved. A monster who killed to avoid thinking about everyone else he killed. A monster named the High Executioner. 
        But that was not his name. Heavens above, Trent sobbed, that has never been my name. Once, he was Trent — a war hero, a light of the people, hope. Now, he didn’t know what to call himself. He wasn’t a hero. Not any longer, and he didn’t want to be the High Executioner.
Trent moaned, clenching his fists in the blasted agony. He couldn’t take it. Skies, he couldn’t handle it anymore. He felt like he was being ripped apart, piece by piece as his heart splintered. He couldn’t do it. He couldn’t do it. It hurts so bad! Make it stop! 
His throat tightened, his breath quick and shallow. It hurt. Skies, why did his guilt hurt so bad! Anything to make it stop — anything to make it end. He couldn’t do it anymore. He thought of his mother. Skies! The pain was like a weight in his stomach, grinding him into oblivion. He couldn’t take it. It was too much. It was too much. Make it stop. Please, heavens above, make it stop! 
His fingers clawed at his face, tearing away flesh. Pain, sensation — anything to give him relief from his despair. But nothing was strong enough. Blood ran down his glove, coating it in a glossy sheen. That was his legacy: blood, pain, anguish. It seemed he couldn’t stay away from it. 
Skies! Make it stop!
        He groaned, as Selean sobbed softly into Sibier’s shoulder. The boy didn’t move. Trent’s stomach coiled as he saw those hollowed eyes, seeing himself in the reflection. A bloodied wrecth, a tyrant covered in scrapes and bruises. A killer. A monster. Skies, he saw the High Executioner in Sibier’s eyes. Then where was he? Where was Trent?
        Then, when he saw Sibier, he saw the man he should have been. 
        The guilt crashed into him with another crescendo, deafening all other emotion. He had killed the hero in him, and then he had killed the hero in others. He swallowed, his throat dry. He couldn’t take the agony. Skies, its all too much. Make it go away! He couldn’t do it. He couldn’t do it. He couldn’t do it.
        A shallow breath. Then another. His arms shuddered, his legs shivered and his eyes twitched. Who was he? What good have I done? What did I do it for? For his family. For mother, father, Sasha… Selean. 
        His heart shattered in his chest. He didn’t do it for Selean. He had crushed her by killing Sibier. Had anything he had done really been for his family? Despair rose in his chest, the anguish pressing him down. It all hurt. He had never felt so much pain in his life. I can’t take it. I can’t take it. Two shallow breaths. Make it stop. Make it stop! His hand ripped out hair. Please, no more! No more! Have mercy on my soul!
        He looked up, and for a second, he met Selean’s broken eyes. Quickly, she jolted away, burying her head back in Sibier. </Unknown> “You aren’t my brother,” she whimpered. </Unknown> “You’re… you’re… you’re like the rest of them.” She sniffed, her words barely a whisper. But Trent heard them. They shattered his soul. Selean continued. </Unknown> “You're worse than even Icar. You aren’t,” she choked, sobbing. </Unknown> “You aren’t family.”
        The little light left in Trent went dark. The tiny flicker of hope — extinguished. Nothing left to see… everything was darkness. Black. That was it. Just pain. Just agony. Just anguish. Nothing left. There was nothing left for him to do, nothing left for him to love, and nothing left for him to live for. Nothing at all.
        He didn’t have a family any longer. Skies, the kingdom would be better off without him. 
        Trent stumbled to his feet, shaking. Why? Why couldn’t I have died long ago! The stars decided to give him the mercy he asked for. There was nothing left for him to do. He would go to the depths. He would take his endless torment, but at least he wouldn’t be alive. He wouldn’t have to live any longer with that guilt. 
        Trent stepped to the edge of the bridge, peering over. Karia had fallen off here — it was time he joined her. The pain. The guilt. The anguish. It would all be gone soon. I can’t take it. I can’t take it. 
        He turned, looking at Selean for the final time. Tears pooled in his eyes, as he marveled at his sister. Such a wholesome person that I had torn apart. He had ruined her. That was something that he could never forgive. He faced the ocean, closing his eyes. Guilt. Pain. Anguish. 
        Heartache. Despair. Guilt. 
        He turned his chin up, whispering his last words. </Unknown> “I’m sorry.”
        He stepped off the bridge.
        What have I done?

Sibier’s Legacy
Epilogue
























</Unknown> “Sister, would he be proud?”
Selean caught Ilyian’s gaze, meeting the nineteen year old dear eyes. </Unknown> “Yes,” she ruefully remembered. </Unknown> “Sibier’s pride shines down from the stars.”
Ilyian gave a short nod, pulling the single black glove tighter around his hand. Its leather was cured with old blood, the other in the pair lost to the depths. For what must’ve been the hundredth time, Ilyian peered into the mirror. Dark hair, sharp blue eyes, a hopeful smile. That was how Sibier had been. Tears welled in his eyes, as he fought to keep them rolling from his cheeks. He didn’t really know his brother, but Selean had told him every story. Ilyian owed everything to him. He wished… he shook his head. He shouldn’t be wishing for those things. But still, he wished he could give his brother a hug. He wished he could hear his brother’s words. To see him. To know how he did it all.
Selean came up behind him, placing a hand on his shoulder. </Unknown> “Ilyian, I am also proud. Sibier would want nothing more than you to lead this community.”
Ilyian swallowed, eyes flickering to his well-combed hair. I don’t feel ready, but he kept his doubts silent. If this is what the stars wished, then he would listen. </Unknown> “I’m only nineteen. Why do they want me as a king?”
</Unknown> “Sibier was only nineteen when he found me. He was only nineteen when he started the community, when he brought back hope to the kingdom,” she paused, mustering the strength to continue. Ilyian remained silent, knowing the pain his sister still hid within her. Even after fifteen years, her love for Sibier hadn’t diminished. </Unknown> “This is your mantle to carry, Ily.”
He nodded, listening to the horns outside. He placed his ungloved hand on the pommel of Trent’s old blade, his heart beating in his chest. I have bested the heti army — I can accept the role of king. He knew the heti would come back, but for now, after destroying the island where they could land, the heti couldn’t assault the kingdom. A temporary victory, and one Ilyian would have to ensure that lasted. 
Ilyian turned to Sasha, her hand locked with her husband’s, the current king. In only moments, they would step down for him to take the throne. A bridge between legacies: Trent’s and Sibier’s. Selean had never married.
Boots clipping behind him, Ilyian marched outside. Stars glittered overhead, bunched in millions, their light shining lovingly. Hundreds of people gathered before him, expectantly looking at their new ruler. 
Ilyian closed his eyes, taking a deep breath. Thank you. 
He pumped his fist in the air. The crowd erupted into cheers. 
        Fifteen years ago, Sibier had done it. Fifteen years ago, Sibier had accomplished his goals. Fifteen years ago, Sibier had brought food to those who needed it. 
        And so much more.
Thank you.

[b]Writing Group Feedback
Feedback
Positive
Like the character of Icar
Loves the point where pulling the sword closer
Why do they want the point of the blade? What's wrong? Suspenseful
Held up on Trent not killing him
Enjoys the cold opening (Feels like Mistborn and Lord Ruler)
Good with sensations
Thoughts for Karia and relationship between them
The Trials are creepy (Hunger Games vibes)
Like the curse words </Unknown> “Heavens above,” and </Unknown> “Skies”
Like Trent (He feels like a good boy); Like that Karia holds him
Karia feels like a good character
What’s Trent’s arc?




Constructive
Feels like a slowness… maybe too much to headspace? Help with pacing. Less thoughts. </Unknown> “Let's do something!”
What's the relationship between Trent and Icar? Why does Icar need Trent?
He isn’t there for family? Add more clarity for whats at stake if he doesn’t beat this guy
What type of world is it? Where are they at?
More urgency -> less thoughts
[c]An idea -> What if Icar just isn't beaten? Maybe wrings the sword out of Trent's hands, and the gets the knife pulled on him or something
[d]Its nearly a page before Trent responds to this...
[e]Feedback on Chapter 2:
Lots of feeling that slowed down the tension
Wants to know what the Trials are (big question)
Why is King Icar insistent about it? Is somebody forcing Icar’s hands
Very excited about Karia being a bad guy
Why would the Trials not end if Icar was killed?
They like that his whole family is there
Like the King’s personality (good juxtapose to Trent)
Want to know more behind the revolution? 
Does the King have good intents like Darth Vader 
Like the control between King Icar and Trent, and the feelings there
Why doesn't King Icar just doesn’t kill Trent? Why does he punch the stone? Does he have some kind of powers?
Trent’s plight feels reasonable
[f]Chapter Three Feedback
Chapter 1
Readers understand the plot and what's at stakes very well
They feel the dissension between the family at Trent’s choice with the family
They feel like Sibier’s family is prisoners: the idea may be only slightly confused.
They feel chapter 3 is very sad and is very good. 
They are wondering where Karia is. 
Does Icar have </Unknown> “Mind control over Trent?” or is it just the motivation? Not super clear (Only Jenna feels the vibe). 
Feels like it's beyond the control during the action scene.
They felt for Trent so bad. It felt painful in a good way - very good
They feel like Sibier is going to be an important character. 
!!! RETURN TO THIS !!!! The reader Evan hopes that Sibier kills Trent
Jenna and Annie hopes Karia comes back and calls Trent as a coward, and that Karia fights Trent. 
They want to know what the Trials are
They can see the loop of Sibier killing Trent and then becoming the High Executioner
Will Trent be redeemed? Karia? Greek Tragedy?
Save the Kingdom for Trent? Or is saving his family more important?
Will there be a darker side of Trent? 
They want to see Trent try harder to be a good guy.
[g]This chapter is moved far below
[h]So we need to change this
[i]This changed
[j]This is the first description of Karia. ... Its rather far into the book
[k]Anyone got a better idea here?
[l]I am so back and forth on including any direct mentions to the Heti. 


I feel it might be more interesting if I could somehow weave more indirect illusions to the threat -> how could I do that?


For here, I could say </Unknown> "and our apeasements would have failed" or something similar, but I fear that just might lead to confusion
[m]I am unsure about this next section. 


Do I want it explained, or somehow figured out? 


I think figured out is better, so maybe I will give some thought about how to incorporate that throughout the book.
[n]I'm really unsure about the part following this. 


Surely there is a better way. I'll be thinking about it
[o]Do I delete this and just leave it implied?
[p]This chapter needs some work I feel.  I still am on the verge of just deleting it.
[q]I really like this paragraph, but I feel as though the ideas may be a bit jumbled or confusing. 


how does it read?
[r]I feel like this adds clarity, but kinda feels out of tone, or lowers the tension. What say ye?
[s]Do I make this two chapters?
[t]Or maybe </Unknown> "it never gets easier"
[u]Too wordy here?
[v]So its at this point I come to consider this idea:


The reader already knows Sibier will catch the blade. I am tempted to make this scene cut back and forth more often between the two viewpoints so these moments happen closer together. 


Or is this way better?
[w]I think switching between the two to avoid repetition would be good.
[x]I'm torn if I should make it difficult for Trent to win or not


It seems more reasonable for it to be difficult -- he's fighting himself, but I'm not sure... Maybe if I do that I get more time for him to think about what he is fighting?
[y]Maybe become?
[z]This has great parallels to the rest of the book though. 


We can change all of them to become... which has greater meaning I feel


Here at the trials, suicide, and freedom.
[aa]Additionally, these last 3 paragraphs are supposed to feel pretty pivotal to Trent's character: do they feel that way?
[ab]Alternatively for this paragraph


</Unknown> "In her arms, Trent felt the harsh edges of his world soften, the anger and fear that had fueled him dissolving in the warmth of her presence. For the first time in what felt like an eternity, he felt a semblance of peace, a hint of the man he used to be before the weight of his title and the burdens it carried had changed him. Holding Karia close, he allowed himself to breathe, to feel the tension drain from his body, and to momentarily forget the chaos that awaited them beyond the cell."
[ac]Check this part. We need to confirm we had mentioned Trent's brothers death already, and if not explain it
[ad]This is a first draft --> needs great editing
[ae]Thoughts on this sentence?
[af]I need to make sure she is able to actually recover her sword...
[ag]The Goal of this chapter is to help show some complexity and interaction between the party, as well as help transition between ideas. 


I'm wondering how I can make this more engaging, and drive the plot forward a little more. Thoughts?
[ah]This idea of getting seaweed isn't introduced yet
[ai]Goals of this scene: Dvelop Werrin's character more. Show that deep down he has a good heart, but also that he is more of an oppertunist. Try to show that he is in a tough spot because the kingdom is taking away needed forces that he needs (because they are losing the war with the Darkened Dawn), and it is piling stress ontop of him. 


Also show Sibier's </Unknown> "gutsy" ness and going against the original plan and taking some risks to persue his dream. This is intended to make him appear a little more human, and less :perfect</Unknown> "
[aj]Goal of second scene: Show how Sibier almost instinctively leans on Karia, but also has a little distrust towards her. Build Werrin’s character, and show his hatred towards the Darkened Dawn. Have Werrin mentioned his concern for his two daughters? -> give depth there
[ak]I used this word a bit in this chapter. Better word choice here or above?
[al]I am trying to think of another verb that captures this better
[am]Are the words 'his' clear to who its referencing here?
[an]There's two options here: 1st, have him be terifiied that he killed someone, or 2nd, have him feel empty, emotionless.


I think I'm going to do the second one for now
[ao]better phrase here
[ap]Do I give him a name?


Its interesting refering him as a m"man</Unknown> " the whole time, as that's how Trent will see it. 


However, would the reader grow more attached if he has a name? That might be more important
[aq]Reading through the second time, I actually might play it as both, in an attempt to portray Trent's split personality
[ar]I love the parralels of this phrase to the ending scenes of the book -- Remember that 


Note for me
[as]Also a parralell to earlier with what Karia said to him
[at]I am wondering if about now if I need to give the reader an emotional break. 


These are some heavy chapters with a similar depressant stacked onto each other, one after the other.


Its possible I could switch the order of the chapters with Trent doing the trials and when he visits with Sasha
[au]Could be any name --> think a symbolic name here would be great
[av]Could I have a scene where they go there?
[aw]or soul
[ax]"At long last, it appears Icar has finally found the secret to bring about the long-awaited resurrection of our people’s Heti</Unknown> " -- Darkened Dawn when Sibier is unconsious
[ay]How can I increase the mystery element here?
[az]We need to increase the number of men to about fifty
[ba]I want this phrase here to be worded perfectly to highligh Sibier's contradictions. 


thoughts to improve it?
[bb]Is this fully accurate of what I want to describe Werrin like?
[bc]I want to say "truly rested</Unknown> " but that conflicts with him playing with his family earlier
[bd]"Morality for his actions</Unknown> " references Sibier's dislike of Werrin joining the kingdom
[be]This line here and paragraph need a lot of thought


It need to be consistent with the overall narrative with both their characters. I am not sure this is the best it can be, but I think its good
[bf]I want to have amoment where Sibier reflects on that Werrin joined the kingdom
[bg]Thoughts on this> Get rid of it? Do i need to unpack this thought more?
[bh]Section break placeholder
[bi]more on this here? Or is the description with Sibier enough?


I want to say this is plenty
[bj]What if I did my chapter heading's like this and have the quotes be from their ancient texts
[bk]I feel I want to add to this idea
[bl]This word could be anything...


Like "How can I?</Unknown> "
or even nothing
[bm]Section break placeholder
[bn]I could end the chapter here
[bo]Is this phrase better implied?
[bp]Section break placeholder
[bq]Questionable to keep? 


I like this, but maybe a better way to do it
[br]Hmm, this line needs to be more impactful
[bs]Is this clear enough
[bt]Section break placeholder
[bu]This feels like something you would put on the back of a book
[bv]Seaweed Collecting and recruitment
Sibier uses the equipment to harvest the food. Immediately after he takes it to the streets, where he rallies men to join his cause. A Kingdom Guard tries to arrest him, in which Sibier flaunts his power. Many follow him after this.
Goal: Show some of Sibier’s hubris and pride as he flaunts that he is the “messias”
Also show Karia’s growing concern and worry at Sibier’s behavior, seeing that he is showing signs of Trent’s own twist of behavior
[bw]The Preaching is showed by Trent's perspective in the next chapter
[bx]Maybe we could ask GPT its thoughts on this chapter, and how it can be made more meaningful
[by]This is the first scene from Trent's perspective after the big battle
[bz]Trent goes to Sibier’s house and finds his clothes and has reflective time. After returning the the stronghold, Icar orders him out again to get Sibier.
Goal: Have this be a heavy contrast to his earlier behavior at the rebellion
After this part, he goes out to find Sibier doing another one of his </Unknown> “street preaches”, where the kid is handing out food, and recruiting. Trent gives Sibier the diapers in an act of kindness and then they battle, in the which Trent kills Yorin. Yorin is also stoking the crowd’s belief in the </Unknown> “messias”
Goal: Throughout this scene, Trent is half heartedly trying, and fights with sadness. Show the difference in emotion from their earlier battle. (Also, keep it shorter)
[ca]I don't feel there needs to be as much reflection about Trent's state here. Maybe we could put a greater focus on what he saw down at the ocean?
[cb]Name for this
[cc]Less Anachronistic here?
[cd]Continue the previous scene from Sibier’s perspective. The crowd around them grows bigger and bigger, and Sibier is raging. Selean intercedes, and Trent falters, and Sibier knocks him out. Terit goes to kill Trent, but Sibier stops him, and then Selean carries him off, and the crowd grows crazy.
Goal: Contrast Sibier’s hatred for Trent with his love for Selean. Also show how he feels like he failed both Selean, Terit, and Yoirin, and contrast that to the cheering crowd and his growing success.

[cf]Selean carrying Trent | Trent chat with Icar and Mother
[cg]Goal: Give Slean more depth through Trent’s perspective. 
Second part -- written on comment. Icar threatens Trent with a knife at his mother’s throat. Trent begs, commits to be a general to fight off the Heti, and Icar yields to give the food to the kingdom. He also promises to figure out the Trials before the fortmoon when the Heti come. 
Goal: Increase the steaks, and foreshadow for the finale of the book. Show Trent becoming increasingly desperate and unsure how to move forwards. Highlight the great uncertainty in his character, and the complexity of the situation

[ci]Start this scene with guilt then transition to bitter rage with him giving all of the blame
[cj]I actually love this following scene... I'm thinking having Icar have a knife to the throat of his mother during the whole time. 


Trent grows desperate, and offers the solution of keeping the food and giving it out, and training to be a general against the Heti, and promises that he will figure out the Trials. 


King doesn't end up killing his mother, but leaves Trent knowing that he would
[ck]Plot line again:

Goal: Increase the steaks, and foreshadow for the finale of the book. Show Trent becoming increasingly desperate and unsure how to move forwards. Highlight the great uncertainty in his character, and the complexity of the situation
[cl]Sibier’s worry for Selean and discussion with Terit
Goal: Foreshadow’s Terit’s betrayal, as Terit wishes he had more power… that he could have saved Yorin. Also show Sibier’s compassionate side, but also a tiny tendency to get angry when Terit accuses him.
Goal: Also have parts that show how much success they are having and that he is starting to fulfill the dream -- of course this is laced with the problems from part A
[cm]Foreshadow Terit's betrayal here, and show that he is jealous of Sibier's power, and maybe even partly blame Sibier for not doing more... though keep it so he mainly blames himself. 


A powerful line would be </Unknown> "If I had your power, I could have saved him"
[cn]NEW SCENE: Trent is giving away the food he captured from the Darkened Dawn, and is restoring the kingdom’s repertoire, actively recruiting new people. He gives food to Terit, and he recognizes the man. Later he sees the Darkened Dawn whispering to Terit
Goal: Show’s Trent’s anguish at feeding the man who cut off his hand, and his back and forth mentality. He does nothing.
Also show his fear giving out this food and risking the Heti
[co]I'm thinking about swicthing these scenes orders. We can have Trent instead trying to gaurd the food... when Icar is captured.  Have him realize he is gaurding the wrong thing?


NEW SCENE:
Trent is leaving a meeting with Icar when Icar’s Sister captures Icar, and then Trent is forced to be the emperor.
Goals: Be a major twist in the story, and give Trent the power he has to start reforming the kingdom with no success and leave him to harsh tactics like King Icar.

[cq]Selean and Sibier connection | Karia’s dissension
Goal: Build up the romance between Selean and Sibier. Also show Karia’s unease and attempt to change Sibier’s community into a rebellion because of the fall in favor. Most of them are expecting it anyway because he is the </Unknown> “Messiah” and he is supposed to give war. Sibier flatly refuses. 
Show some of Sibier’s hotheaded personality, and stubbornness, but also grow his admiration and love for Selean
[cr]This scene is where Sibier actually starts to lose followers to Trent's rebuilding the Kingdom and giving out food. 


Karia sees it, and recognizes now is their only chance. Also, she has been hurting ever since the raid on the Darkened Dawn
[cs]Terit betrays Sibier in similar fashion to Judas to DD; Sibier decides on war on the DD
Scene Progression: While Sibier is rallying for people (street preaching) Terit betrays Sibier. He feels hurt, and they take him away -- Selean goes and gets help, and Karia comes back and rescues Sibier, and fights off the Darkened Dawn, but they steal back their equipment. Sibier decides the group is going to prepare on War
Goal: move plot forward, and show Sibier’s deep hurt, and portray his naivety and over-optimism as flaws. Also show the greater unrest, and people’s distrust in the kingdom to protect them from the DD
[ct]Feel like I need something better here
[cu]I need better punctuation here, but I'm not sure how to do it
[cv]This could be a new part
[cw]Remember to add guards outside the door that sound the alarm else this is a minor plot error
[cx]The Darkened Dawn ambush Sibier’s Community - They want to steal all the food Sibier’s community has created
Scene Progression: Sibier awakes, and he places himself in front of the whole army so the others can escape. At the end, Sibier ends up in full out warfare when they get cut off. Sibier kills the DD leader in a one-on-one bout
Goal: Show Sibier’s desperation, and also his hope to keep his dream and community alive… and also his sacrifice and pain, and giving up everything as he goes to single handedly face a legion
[cy]Pick up on outline number 32.
[cz]Should I add a part where teh Heti see Sibier's curse and gets mad that the humans are trying to replicate their power?
[da]No... we don't need depth in the Heti ;)
[db]Have Sibier go to save Trent here first, and then have Icar save them both
[dc]Focus more on Trent and Sibier working together, and King Icar can be more a side note helping them
[dd]Don't have the Heti turn on them, but instead have Trent, Sibier and Icar overcome them --> the Heti runs to save the food, and that gives Trent the chance he needs to kill it with the knowledge he learned from the Trials
[de]The chapter ends with that
[df]That the right word?
[dg]Ha, thats actually a great name -- we need to make sure they are all the same at some point. Consistency would be good
[dh]Unsure if I want to keep this part or not.
