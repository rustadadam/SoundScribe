Rebels never do . You see yourself as so righteous , so virtuous , and so honorable as you claim to fight for a better future . That 's not what others see . I see fraud . I see unfulfilled promises . I see unnecessary fighting , pain , war . Death . And all of it under the false banner of hope . ”" "“ If you would only lower your tithes we would n't have to fight . You suppress the people underneath your heel : they can not survive like that ! Do n’t you dare tell me that you do n’t see all the starving children in the streets . They would have money to buy food without your incessant tithes ! ”" "“ Then why do you eat three meals a day ? ”" "“ No one else in this kingdom has that privilege . ”" "“ And you are quick to assume , you ingrate . Rarely do I have that privilege . ”" "“ You ’re a liar . Why do n’t you just wipe out the Darkened Dawn ? ”" "“ No , ”" "“ No , I wo n’t help you . ”" "“ The seas are losing their fish . Our fields are underproducing . And our enemies raise their tribute each year . Soon there will be no food , leaving us with no choice but to risk our lives to harvest seaweed . ”" "“ Then forgo your demonic Trials , ”" "“ Stop wasting all of our resources to kill our own people ! ”" "“ What — ”" "“ Who are these blasted Heti ? ”" "“ Enough , ”" "“ Take me back to my family . ”" "“ You help me , and I guarantee their safety . You do n’t make any demands . Understand ? ”" "“ If anything happens to my family , Icar , I will put a sword to your throat . Their safety better be guaranteed , heavens above . ”" "“ I saved your life ! ”" "“ What would you have me do ? ”" "“ So be it . ”" " They think I 'm gone , " " Maybe it 's better to be a ghost than a monster in their eyes .

That you were the one who let the riot unfold , the one who failed to strike down three derelicts ? ”" "“ You better leave me alone , urchin . ”" "“ You kill me here and you ’ll look even more like the culprit , ”" "“ I have friends watching right now who ’d be happy to testify they saw you on Earl ’s Road .

Do you want to be a part of it ? ”" "“ Please ! ”" "“ Easy , it 's just me , ”" " I need a favor , " " Could you keep an eye on Ilyian for a bit ? I have to go somewhere .

24045	24054	24040	24040	He	4044	” Werrin , unmoved , faced Sibier squarely . “
24076	24077	24073	24073	you	31	” “
24083	24216	24078	24078	You	31	” Siber snapped . His tone shocked himself , uncharacteristically like him , but at the moment he did n’t care . He was hungry , scared , stressed and worried . Skies , he could almost feel his parents watching him from the stars . They had taught him that the family was always supposed to stick together — no matter what . If he abandoned Ilyian , he would give up a part of who he was . He would give up their dream . He would give up the Sogni legacy . He took a deep breath and closed his eyes , a prayer in his mind . Heavens above , help . I ca n’t let that happen . Pulling off his gloves , Werrin folded his arms . “
24226	24230	24221	24221	I	0	” he challenged . “
24251	24257	24258	24258	I	0	” Sibier did n’t relent . “
24263	24286	24258	24258	I	0	” He rustled with his shackles . Werrin sighed , the finality in his voice a cold hand around Sibier 's heart . " " Secure him . " " To exist like this is worse than death , " "“ Help . Me . ”" "“ For Ilyian ! ”" "“ FOR ILYIAN ! ”" "“ Sounds familiar , ”" "“ Have we met before ? ”" "“ If it 's alright with you , I ’ll be on my way , ”" "“ May we meet again . ”" "“ Dad ! ”" "“ Father and mother , I ’m sorry . ”" " Stop the trial , " " Halting now jeopardizes everything we 've worked for . " "“ Stop the trial , '' he demanded . Icar ’s voice was even , always in control . “" "” In frustration , Trent hit his side , squinting in pain . Blast that man ! He cursed mentally . He does n’t deserve a seat among the stars . And what about you ? a little piece of him asked . His blood went cold , and a deepening crevice widened inside of him . Sibier winced , and the kid ’s pain reverberated down into the echoes of his soul . Am I any better ? As if in response to his hurt , the mist coalesced into a dark form , mocking Trent ’s silent pleas for Sibier ’s deliverance . Icar ’s detached explanation only made it worse . "" " Trent felt sick . He itched to do something , yet he felt immobilized . “
30733	30737	30573	30573	His	31	” he started , “
30751	30776	30740	30740	we	884	” Icar kept silent , staring emptily ahead . The king ’s quiet pressed against Trent ’s nerves , his anger threatening to explode . “
30783	30787	30789	30789	me	0	” he cursed . “
30792	30812	30813	30813	We	884	” Icar was not fazed by Trent ’s outburst , but spoke softly , as if burdened by memories . “
30827	30850	30851	30851	I	0	” he paused , then shuddered . He jabbed two of his fingers forward , his other hand grasping his cursed arm . “
30880	30900	30859	30859	Heti	40	” his voice was remorseful , and even filled with pain , as though he was reliving the moment . “
30905	30958	30859	30859	Heti	40	” Trent felt no pity for the King . How could he as he watched Sibier endure the very pains worse than the very depths of themselves ? Sibier backed away from the mist as it swirled and stung him , its form becoming a warrior . Skies , he needed something ! “
30975	30976	30977	30977	We	886	” “
30981	30987	30977	30977	We	886	” King Icar answered shortly . “
30995	31008	30988	30988	They	887	” Exasperated , Trent threw his hands in the air , roaring . “
31015	31043	31013	31013	you	888	” King Icar leaned in , his hand cutting through the air to demand silence , his eyes alight with a sudden mixture of curiosity and awe . “
31049	31416	31045	31045	you	888	” he whispered , a tone that beckoned Trent 's full attention . Trent , still simmering with anger and disbelief , could n't help but be drawn to the spectacle . Sibier , illuminated by a mysterious purple glow reminiscent of Icar 's own aura , wielded a pipe with unexpected prowess . The boy was a whirlwind of desperation and determination , battling the mist that seemed almost sentient in its attack . Trent 's heart caught in his throat . The resemblance to Icar ’s mystical abilities was uncanny . Could it be ? Did the Trials work ? Had they finally created magic ? Trent almost refused to believe it . Even though doubt clawed at Trent , he found himself unable to tear his eyes away from Sibier ’s valiant struggle . Each movement , each swing , each strike was a testament to a burgeoning power Trent had never witnessed . With a move of pure desperation , Sibier plunged the pipe through the figure , dissolving it into a cloud of mist . Trent stepped closer , a prayer on his lips . You got this , Sibier . Just … survive . But doubt shadowed his hope . How did anyone even survive the Trials ? How could Sibier possibly find his way out of this nightmare ? The very concept of survival within the Trials seemed a cruel joke , an impossible feat designed to torment both subject and observer . As the mist coalesced once more , it formed figures all too familiar and Trent felt a cold dread grip him . He instantly recognized Sibiers parents . The apparitions were locked in their final moments just as they had been in reality , Sibier ’s mother hunched over her father . The sight of her tears dripping from her cheeks onto her husband was like a crushing hand over his soul.[u ] In anguish , Trent hit his side again , squinting through the jolts of pain . It was easier than dealing with the emotional echo of horror before him . Icar , ever the observer , murmured to himself , lost in thought . " " No , " " I am your superior , " " Obey . " " To me , you 're nothing more than the traitor who 's already lost , " " Come and claim your blasted key scum . " "“ You should have known that they call me the High Executioner , ”" "“ There is so much to explain , ”" "“ I saved him from the Trials , and he needs attention now . ”" "“ What is it ? ”" "“ We have to hurry then . Blast it , once your out of here , I ’ll search the castle for that blasted medicine . They ca n’t keep it from me this time . ”[ad" "“ Follow me , ”" " Help us , " " Trent , " " the trials have not been kind to your young friend there . ”
36711	36739	36680	36680	he	31	“ At long last , it appears Icar has finally found the secret to bring about the long - awaited resurrection of our people ’s Heti[ae ] . " "“ Run ”" "“ Karia , ”" "“ Go now . ”" "“ You wo n’t touch them . ”" "“ You know not what you do by withholding our evidence from us , ”" "“ Get out of our way . ”" "“ I do n’t care , ”" "“ Another step , and I will kill you . ”" "“ Stop that , ”" "“ I ’m sorry , ”" "“ I understand your pain — ”" "“ Blast it , ”" "“ Do you know what he did to my family ? ”" "“ He murdered them , ”" "“ Without mercy . ”" "“ My fathers name was David . David Sogni . ”" "“ I ’m sorry . Forgive me . ”" "“ Then you know how I feel , ”" "“ and I know how you feel . ”" "“ And it hurts so bad , ”" "“ It feels as though a part of you was torn away and given to swine . The anguish is so insufferable that it feels like it can never be healed , and never corrected . ”" "“ But there is more to the pain than just hurt , ”" "“ There is growth … but only if you do n’t let it keep you down . ”" "“ Karia , from this we can create a new community , a place where there is no heartache , no starvation . A place where we can be free and save lives . It will be like a dream . ”" "“ No , the rebellion ’s fire has been extinguished . But we can create a kingdom where no child hungers on the streets , where no one begs for food . A place where no one hides from the shadows , and where trust reigns . ”" "“ You can make this world a better place , Karia . People brighten when they see you — they rally behind who you are . They encourage your every step , and they will defend you with fierce loyalty . Surely they will come , Karia , and we can leave the tyrants of this kingdom behind . ”" "“ You do n’t understand , ”" "“ We do n’t have to fight anyone . My father had found a trove of food underneath the islands — we can harvest and feed the people . Those on the streets will come to us , and we will have food and work for them . We can build our own kingdom without tearing one down . That is the vision ! ”" "“ I brought a friend , ”" "“ Everyone belongs , ”" "“ I promised you a place where no one hungers again , did n’t I ? That means everyone . ”" "“ Well Karia is going to help us with that , ”" "“ We are n’t starting a rebellion , ”" "“ But we are building a new community . Creating a new district where there will be food and work , separate from the kingdom . ”" "“ Because this time , we have a vision and a legacy to follow . There ’s a secret to these islands , Terit , and I know it . ”" "“ community ”" "“ Terit , ”" "“ we plan on getting all of those . ”" "“ How , ”" "“ We are n’t the only ones who know this secret , ”" "“ From Karia ’s intel , I believe the Darkened Dawn already knows too , and they might already have the equipment we need . “" "” “" "” Terit answered , throwing another rock off of the cliff . “" "” Once again , Karia turned to Sibier , her voice a low hiss . “" "” Sibier nodded , kissing Ilyian lightly on his forehead before setting him down . “" "”" "“ Are you sure ? ”" "“ Lets go . ”" "“ I was praying , ”" "“ Did you come back to accept my offer ? ”" "“ No . I came to ask for your help . ”" "“ I did n’t escape , ”" "“ I survived . ”" "“ The rumors , ”" "“ Do you have magic ? ”" "“ I need a favor , Captain . ”" "“ What kind of favor ? ”" "“ I need your men to steal equipment from the Darkened Dawn and to bring me with you . ”" "“ Do n’t , ”" "“ because we need your help to do it . We are going to create a better world . ”" "“ We are n’t starting any rebellion , ”" "“ We are building a place where no one has to starve again . Skies , we are fixing this kingdom instead of tearing it apart . ”" "“ Yes , ”" "“ Do n’t you have a family ? ”" "“ Do n’t you want to fix this blasted kingdom for them ? ”" "“ Blast it , kid . I ’ve spent my whole life trying to make enough to feed my family . But with the Darkened Dawn constantly raiding the fishing holes and burning our crops , there simply is n’t enough food . ”" "“ We can get food for your family , ”" "“ But we need that equipment from the Darkened Dawn . ”" "“ I have something the Kingdom does n’t , ”" "“ We could conquer the Darkened Dawn and unearth their secrets . Imagine the legend you would become as the captain to finally bring down their cult . ”" "“ Magic , ”" "“ They did it . ”" "“ This is our chance , ”" "“ But first , we need to steal that equipment from the Darkened Dawn . ”" "“ I ’m in . ”" "“ Heavens above , ”" "“ As you wish . ”" "“ We do n’t , ”" "“ I hate you . ”" "“ With your men ? ”" "“ I ’ll break through , ”" "“ and I wo n’t leave them a scrap . ”" "“ You wo n’t touch her , ”" "“ And now we ’re back to how we were , ”" "“ I understand . ”" "“ The Darkened Dawn saw the boy ? ”" "“ No , ”" "“ Yes . ”" "“ No ! ”" "“ Why are they getting her ? ”" "“ If you touch her , ”" "“ I will not stop until one of us is dead . ”" "“ Save your breath . Spend the day with Sasha — you have tomorrow for decisions . ”" "“ You ca n’t control me . ”" "“ I see they ’ve upgraded your wardrobe . ”" "“ It ’s good to see you , sister , truly . ”" "“ But where are the others ? ”" "“ Occupied , ”" "“ Occupied ? ”" "“ Occupied doing what ? ”" "“ Normal tasks , ”" "“ Are they being tortured , Sasha ? ”" "“ Trent ! ”" "“ Do n’t let it ruin today . You need this time to be happy . Your pain is destroying you ! ”" "“ Okay . I will . ”" "“ Thank you . ”" "“ But Sasha , ”" "“ I will find a way to get us all out of this and I ’ll never let this happen ever again . ”" "“ Skies , one day all those who hurt us now will bow to us ! By the stars above , I promise it . ”" "“ Yes , ”" "“ Where are you taking me ? ”" "“ Exhausted already ? ”" "“ Besides , we 're here . ”" "“ Here ? There 's only — ”" "“ No , not here . ”" "“ Dimwit . ”" "“ Did n’t you just say we ’re here ? ”" "“ And are you always this literal ? ”" "“ Can you push that ? ”" "“ What is this ?

This sight is beautiful , yes , but it ’s hollow . It gives me no meaning . ”" "“ Sasha , this ca n’t undo the things I ’ve done . ”" "“ I do n’t know if I made the right choice , ”" "“ I ’ve ruined families , but I ’ve saved my own . ”" "“ Tell me , Sasha ... what would you have done ? ”" "“ What happened to Selean ? ”" "“ Nothing . She ’s fine . ”" "“ You ’re a terrible liar , Sasha , ”" "“ The family is n’t really locked up in their room , are they ? ”" "“ Skies , ”" "“ To the depths with this all ! ”" "“ Trent stop ! ”" "“ Why are we here then ! ”" "“ We should be with them ! ”" "“ We ca n’t , Trent . The doctors wo n’t let anyone else near her — they barely tolerate our parents . Selean is already at too much risk . ”" "“ Is she going to … ”" "“ Is she going to die like our brother ? ”" "“ The doctors do n’t know , ”" "“ Do n’t say that ! Selean still lives ! ”" "“ No , ”" "“ because now Icar knows that I ’m indebted to him .

Apparently the Darkened Dawn and King Icar are after the same thing : something the man called the resurrection . It had something to do with the mist from yesterday , and those Tri[ay]als . ”" "“ What is it ? ”" "“ That does n’t affect what we 're doing , ”" "“ Did you find a way into their storehouses ? ”" "“ Do you think we ’ll get caught ? ”" "“ This ’ll do . ”" "“ I think we ’ve given them enough time , ”" "“ Let ’s go , ”" "“ Before they come back . ”" " After me , men ! " "“ And the stars shall be stricken with grief , and shall be tram[bj]pled under the feet of men , treated as things of naught . Darkness will be a blanket over their minds . ”" "” She stepped forwards , her bloody finger pointing at him . “" "” She cursed , her tone shifting instantly . “" "“ Right , ”" "“ They ’re coming ! ”" "“ Why are you even here ? ”" "“ I have fought before , ”" "“ The Stars will Shine in the Day of Destruction ”" "“ Arrest that boy , ”" "“ Karia , ”" "“ Bring me the boy . ”" "“ Karia , ”" "“ I need him . To save my family . ”" "“ Do n’t you love me ? ”" "“ I ’m not moving , ”" "“ My men are taking the boy and this food . ”" "“ This is your last chance , ”" "“ Step aside . ”" "” the captain ordered , his tone unyielding . His gaze never left Trent ’s . Sibier ’s fingers tightened around the sword . “" "” Werrin repeated , his tone unquestioning , looking back at Sibier . “" "” the High Executioner commanded , “" "” The room held its breath as the High Executioner froze , his expression unreadable . When the High Executioner finally spoke it was barely above a whisper , but carried the weight of a storm . “" "“ Men who only try to feed their families ? Men who prevent riots from spilling blood in the streets ? Not everyone in the kingdom is from the depths , like you ! ”" "” Sibier did n’t wait to see what happened next . He raced toward the door , shoving it open with trembling hands . The storm outside howled in greeting , cold rain pelting his face as thunder rolled across the mountains . The wind whipped at his clothes , like that night before ... A dark chill crawled down his spine , as tears filled Sibier ’s eyes . The night his parents died . He had n’t looked back then . And heavens above , he wished he had . With tears blurring his vision , Sibier turned . Inside the cavern , the scene was chaotic . With a swift movement , the High Executioner kicked out Karia ’s feet , sending her sprawling -- the same way the monster had sent Sibier ’s mother to the ground . Hate boiled in Sibier . Sibier ’s hair whipped at his head , feeling the wind howl behind him . It was cold , but it was nothing compared to the heat inside of him . He felt that rage turn dark , feeding his bitterness . Feeding the raw desire to destroy . His skin crackled near his curse , the veins in his palms glowing a sinister violet . [ bq ] The captain was on his feet again , his wrist twisted at an unnatural angle , his face pale and strained . He stumbled toward his fallen sword , his movements sluggish and pained . Yet , even now , there was something unyielding in his eyes . “" "” Werrin shouted , his voice hoarse but resolute . It cut through the chaos like a knife , piercing straight into Sibier ’s chest . For a moment , the captain ’s gaze locked with his , and Sibier saw something he had seen in his father ’s eyes that night . Save our dreams , his Fathers voice echoed . Save Ilyian . With those thoughts , the hate drained out of him . Leaving him empty . Sibier felt sick . The High Executioner turned to Werrin , his face hardened and unreadable . Werrin lunged for his sword but with mocking ease the High Executioner kicked the blade away . The captain staggered back , his wrist cradled against his chest , but he did n’t retreat . He stood tall , his gaze steady , his breathing labored but unbroken . “" "” Sibier whispered , feeling the cold bite of the weather in his skin , “" "” The High Executioner turned to Sibier , his face expressionless . He wore the same mask of death he had seen every night . In that gaze , Sibier felt so small , and the distance between them was n’t far enough . Five feet . The High Executioner lunged for Sibier , but Werrin jerked forward , catching the High Executioner ’s leg . Roaring , the Rebellion Leader backhanded the captain , sending the man sprawling . “" "“ No , ”" "“ I should feel this . I need to feel this . I killed him . ”" "“ Karia … ”" "“ I need to save my family . ”" "“ Karia , ”" "“ Do n't go there . ”" "“ Of course not ! ”" "“ I love you , Karia ! I love you more than anything ! But heavens above , I need to save my family ! ”" "“ They ’re all I have left ! Selean is sick , and I — I have no other choice ! ”" "“ No , ”" "“ Karia , on the way here , I felt like myself again . Fighting alongside you , saving you — it felt like I was whole again .

Yorin was always the one carrying my weight . He was always the one urging us to do better , and always the one blasted swine that got up and tried again .

Because of my idiocracy . ”" "“ Do you ever wonder why Yorin always stuck with you ? ”" "“ Because I cheated him . ”" "“ No , ”" "“ it ’s because deep down you hold that same goodness .

Maybe not even you understand who you are . ”" "“ Then who does ? ”" "“ No one truly understands , ”" "“ and that 's the joy of it all .

1195	1200	1201	1201	Karia	36	 Hurry , Trent . "" "“ Your family … ”" "“ They were collected as tribute for the Trials . ”" "“ You ’ll need me , ”" "“ To save them , Trent . Only I know where the Trials are . ”" "“ Join me , Trent , ”" "“ and together we will save so much more than just your family . ”" "“ They are under my protection , Trent . As long as I am under yours . ”" "“ And I may be , but I am not evil . No , I did n’t kill your girlfriend , ”" "“ I saved her . ”" " Take his family to their room , and leave us , " " I have matters to discuss with Trent , in private . " "“ Now , ”" "“ With me , you will never have to worry about the safety and care of Karia or your family . Be assured that your family will be well : they will have the best rooms , the best food , the best security — everything that our kingdom has left to offer . ”" "“ Just like you need me , I need you , Trent . I need you to help me save more than just your family . I need you to help me save the people of the Kingdom ! So let us help each other , shall we ? ”" "“ There is nothing you can show me to prove that you are actually interested in saving my people . You wo n’t fool me with your lies . ”" "“ And we as a kingdom can not survive without those tithes , ”" "“ How can you be blind enough not to see the truth ? No one here lives in decadence ! We are under threat by the Heti , and our only option is appraisal by giving them their demanded tribute . That is how we all survive , Trent . Not how you survive . ”" "“ The Darkened Dawn does , ”" "“ They follow their own laws , and they have slipped outside of my grasp , ”" "“ That 's precisely why I need you . I need a seasoned war leader like you to defeat them ! ”" "“ Why are you so blasted stubborn ? ”" "“ Those Trials are our future . They are our only way to beat the blasted Heti ! How shortsighted you are not to understand ! ”" "“ Are you serious ? Your single - minded crusade against my throne blinded you to the true state of our world . How can you be so wilfully ignorant ? ”" "“ Do n’t be a fool , Trent , ”" "“ We can both get what we want : your family can be safe , and I get your help . Easy . ”" "“ And I saved your family ’s lives , ”" "“ You owe their lives thrice over . ”" "“ I hate you . ”" "“ I know . ”" "“ Since you murdered my High Executioner , a position has unexpectedly opened , ”" "“ You will take his place . ”" "“ Have a seat . ”" "“ You let the boy go free , ”" "“ So what ? ”" "“ You are the High Executioner . It 's either those on your list who run the trials or your family . Your choice . ”" "“ I was n't going to let you kill the boy . It would have made no difference , ”" " Why are you so blasted stubborn ! " " Ca n't you see anything beyond your own blinding self - righteousness ? " "” Trent 's hands balled into fists beneath the table , the knuckles whitening . He imagined what it might feel like to punch that crow - like nose … blasted idiot ! Icar leaned forward , his hands pressing flat against the table 's surface , looking like a leopard about to pounce . He lowered his voice to a venomous whisper . “" "” Trent narrowed his eyes , trying to guess King Icar ’s game . Why was the buffoon telling me this ? “" "” the king hissed , “" " He is prepared , " " Let 's begin , " "“ After all the times I ’ve done this , ”" "“ I still hate it[t ] . ”" "“ The kid will likely live far into the trial . He has a fiery determination , and an almost unquenchable hope , ”" "“ He reminds me of you . ”" "“ Yes , he will go far , but I doubt he will live . ”" "“ With this Trial , you 'll fully assume the mantle of High Executioner . ”" "“ Let ’s pray you ’ll finally figure the secret out of trials , and bless our people with power . ”" "“ Indeed we do . ”" "“ No ? Pity , ”" "“ Because after all these years , Trent , I finally found what I was looking for : a cure . The Trials worked . ”" "“ It 's painful . Oh , it 's so delightfully painful , ”" "“ You are going to endure Trial after Trial once my men fix your careless brilliance . You will administer them alone , as I ca n’t afford another accident . ”" "“ I knew we would get along . ”" "” You saw the letters , did n’t you ? ”" "“ They ’re from the Heti , ”" "“ They are demanding more and more , and we do n’t have enough food to pay the monthly tribute . We need more time to run more Trials . And so , we are going to need food to pay the tribute . You are going to steal it from the Darkened Dawn . ”" "“ Take whatever men you need , ”" "“ I want you to make them hurt . Take all of their food stockpiles if you can . ”" "“ You ’re terrified , are n’t you Trent ? ”" "“ Your compliance is a nice change and now we both get what we want : we ’ll save this kingdom . ”" "“ Though Trent , I want you to understand one thing clearly : if you do another thing to cross me again , your mother will be first . ”" "“ I wo n’t touch her , just as you wo n’t defy orders again . ”" "“ We will need to build off of the boy ’s success from these Trials before the Heti feel our tributes dwindle . And you are going to need to find that boy and bring him to me for my experiments . Failure is not an option . ”" "“ I ca n’t . The Darkened Dawn attacked , and Karia escaped with him . ”" "“ Blast the stars above ! ”" "“ Do you know where they went ? ”" "“ Then it is in your best interest to find out , is it not ? ”" "“ You said Karia went with the boy ? ”" "“ Guards ! ”" "“ Bring Sasha here . We will be needing her . ”" "“ You need a little motivation to do the right thing . ”" "“ I wo n’t . Spend the day with her , Trent and then decide if you want her to live . Cripple the Darkened Dawn and find the boy , or continue to fight fruitlessly and watch your family starve . The choice is yours . ”" "“ Control you ? I ’ve never intended to . You ’re too wild , too driven by your misguided emotions . I only want you to see that we ’re on the same side . ”" "“ I want to save this kingdom , ”" "“ Just like you . ”" "“ I expect your recommitment tomorrow , Trent . ”" "“ resurrection ”" " Bring that boy to me . " " Bring that boy to me . " "“ You failed . ”" "“ Trent , tell me how you feel , ”" "“ I can see your not committed enough to this kingdom . Maybe you would like a demonstration with your family ? You betrayed my trust ... is it time I betray yours ? ”" "“ Speak girl , ”" "“ We are running out of time Trent . I need your full commitment . ”" "“ I ’m not going to kill her Trent . ”" "“ I ’m not going to kill any of them . ”" "“ I did n’t ask her to say that . ”" "“ Trent , I need you to understand this . I wo n’t kill you your family if you fail again , but know your family will not survive . ”" "“ We caught a Darkened Dawn spy today . ”" "“ So what ? ”" "“ Do n’t be slow , Trent . The Darkened Dawn is looking to steal back the food we stole . ”" "“ It almost feels like the spy had wanted to be captured . Its like she wants us to know what s coming . ”" "“ We ’re getting close to solving the Trials . The blow to your head is telling , ”" "“ Your skin is scarred with power . Of course it 's too trace to mean any significant , but it does mean the Trials partially worked for the boy -- his punch has left you falling in - and - out of consciousness for days . ”" "“ We almost have what we want from the Trials , ”" "“ but that success is unraveling us . In just the last few days , the word of what the boy has done has spread like wildfire . The entire kingdom is in unrest , mobbings are becoming to commonplace . ”" "“ We do n’t have enough men to manage all of the riots . Even some of the lords are withdrawing their support , looking into these rumored promises of food and wealth from the boy . Our kingdom is falling apart . ”" "“ I do n’t understand how you of all people were gifted with your talent by the stars . ”" "“ No matter the consequence , we must pay tribute to the Heti to buy us an extra year to solve the Trials . That brings me the dilemma Trent . Somehow , someway , we need to protect the food we have from the Darkened Dawn . And that ’s why I need you . ”" "“ I ca n’t give you much men -- almost all of routes back to our kingdom have been destroyed or made inaccessible by the riots , making troop movement impossible . But you know better than anyone the weaknesses in this kingdom . No one can do a better job than you . Protect the food Trent . ”" "“ Thirty , plus my personal gaurd . ”" "“ Valiant II , protect this kid ! ”" "“ Then why am I not dead , tyrant ? ”" "“ And why am I still alive ? ”" "“ Then watch as the rest of your family is brutally murdered in front of you as you are dragged down to be tortured for the rest of your life . Is that what you would choose over your life of honor ? Is defiance the choice your mother would have chosen for you if she knew it would cost her her life ? ”" "“ Do n’t be so naive . You . Are . My . Pawn . ”" "“ Mind control over Trent ? ”"
I: "“ And you ’re naive , Trent , ”" "“ You know barely anything . You ’re more concerned about a few lives than the course of history itself . The suffering you ’re so eager to end — it 's nothing compared to what ’s coming . ”" "“ There is n’t much time before the Trial begins , ”" "“ I already started the process . ”" "“ We are here , brother . All of us , ”" "“ I know , ”" "“ How are they handling that I betrayed them ? ”" "“ You shattered the last flicker of hope they had , Trent . Might as well have thrown your lot in with the Darkened Dawn . ”" "“ The kingdom believes you to be dead , Trent . They 've lost hope — all of it , ”" " The kingdom thinks I 'm dead ? " "“ I understand how you all see me as the villain — your greatest enemy , ”" "“ Do as he requests ; we are not barbarians , ”" "“ I do not want to hear you speak again today , Guard . You would learn well to appreciate the strength of your enemies . Now go . ”" "“ We will see each other again . I promise . ”" "“ She is alive in prison and her wounds were treated , ”" "“ No , Yorin , I 'm not with them , ”" "” Those words were carefully chosen , designed to pick Trent apart nerve by nerve . And to the depths with it , because it worked . “" "” Trent rose abruptly , pounding the table , sending a reverberating echo through the room . “" "” “" "” Icar chuckled , giving his thin , sly smile . “" "” He paused , nearly spitting the next words . “" "” Trent 's hand instinctively drifted to the familiar weight of his sword . In the quiet of the room , it was just him and Icar ... another chance , perhaps , to do what Karia had longed for . “" "” Trent yelled , cutting him off sharply . Icar raised his eyebrow , inspecting him . Trent felt heat rise within him , his fingers curling around the blade . He took a deep breath . When Icar spoke next it was as cold as steel . “" "” Trent 's restraint shattered . With a visceral roar , he drew his blade , its metallic ring slicing through the tension - filled air . He lunged forward , every muscle taut with fury . Icar , with an unnerving calmness , sidestepped Trent 's initial assault . His expression was eerily composed , as if he had anticipated this very moment . To the depths with him ! He swung , his sword cutting through the air , but Icar was ready . The king parried with his own blade , a still , knowing look in his eyes , a sinister tranquility amidst the chaos . "" " Icar warned , his voice steady as if untouched by the storm of violence . Trent ’s response was a guttural scream , his body and soul hurling forward in a relentless assault . Icar retreated with fluid grace , countering with swift , precise strikes . All at once , Trent ’s anger and frustration and hate flooded out of him . His blade was a tempest of steel . In his mind , he saw those orphans clinging to his coat , begging for scraps . He hit harder , and Icar stumbled . He saw himself killing Sibier ’s family . He hit harder , and the King fell to his knees . He saw the betrayal and hurt behind Karia ’s eyes … blast it all ! Trent lifted the blade high above his head , and brought it down with everything he had . And then Icar caught the blade . Trent 's eyes widened in horror . He struggled desperately with the hilt , disbelief coursing through him . How ? Icar 's eyes glowed an unnatural purple , his face contorted with concentration . A chill crept down Trent ’s spine , as he stepped back , wide eyed . Icar ’s gloved hand began to emit a strange , hissing sound , and a sinister purple light enveloped it . Trent ’s sword started to disintegrate right before his eyes , the metal corroding as if consumed by an unseen force . The blade crumpled , the tip falling away like dust in the wind . With the grace of a lynx , Icar deftly pushed aside Trent ’s useless sword , seizing the moment of shock . His hand , wrapped in an aura of sinister purple light , clamped around Trent 's throat , lifting him off the ground . Trent gasped , squirming for breath . His eyes widened , as he gaped down at Icar in panic . The King ’s hand hummed , the purple light only getting brighter . Then , with a sickening squelch , Trent felt as though his soul was being torn out of him . The pain was unbearable . Frantically , Trent kicked and thrashed , but it was futile against Icar 's unnatural strength . His lungs screamed for oxygen , and his soul felt as if it were being peeled away , layer by agonizing layer . Desperately , he wanted to cry out , to beg for mercy , but he could not find his voice . In a silent plea , Trent ’s eyes locked with Icar ’s , a wordless entreaty for his life . " " he tried to mouth , his vision blurring into darkness . The pain was too much . Heavens above , it was too much ! Icar gave his thin smile . He turned his head , his crow - like eyes observed Trent with an unsettling detachment . " " Trent mouthed again , his consciousness teetering on the edge . He clenched his eyes shut , his mind screaming for an end to the torment . He was praying for a miracle . Praying for release . Just make it stop ! Abruptly , Icar released him . Trent collapsed to the floor , each breath a ragged , precious gulp of air . His throat felt scorched by the dark power that had invaded him , leaving a trail of searing agony . Coughing and gasping , Trent 's vision swam chaotically . Inside , he felt his very soul quiver , recoiling from the unspeakable violation it had endured . Finally , Trent choked out the words , each one falling between different breaths . “
22114	22118	22120	22120	you	748	” he gasped , “
22124	22270	22120	22120	you	748	” King Icar , with an air of nonchalance , settled into his chair and slowly removed his gloves . For the first time , Trent saw the king ’s hands laid bare . One was normal , but the other – the one that had gripped him – was a sight of horror . It pulsed with purple veins , its skin etched with deep , canyon - like crevices , a grotesque map of power and corruption . Trent swallowed hard , a primal fear gripping him as he beheld the true extent of Icar 's cursed existence . Icar was more than just a tyrant … he was … he was … he was … Trent shook his head . He did n’t know what Icar was . Heavens above . What had just happened ? Icar spoke , his authority unquestioned . “
22284	22292	22120	22120	you	748	” His words hung in the air . “

22360	22377	22378	22379	The king	186	“ No , I did n’t go through the Trials ; I survived something much worse . ”
22394	22417	22384	22384	his	186	“ The Heti attacked my people when I was a kid . I was the only one who escaped to this kingdom . ”

22541	22548	22549	22549	Trent	31	“ What happened to those people ? ”
22552	22567	22549	22549	Trent	31	“ They were slaughtered like livestock , and their attack did this to me . ”
22606	22623	22624	22624	Trent	31	“ If [ n]you're not from here , then you 're not King Visio ’s son , ”
22634	22637	22638	22638	he	32	“ Obviously , ”
22651	22695	22638	22638	he	32	“ The King found me nearly dead where the Island touches the ocean . They saw my powers as a gift from the stars , and knew that I would be the answer to free this kingdom from the grasp of the Heti . ”
22735	22741	22742	22742	Icar	32	“ So they adopted you ? ”
22803	22837	22846	22847	King Icar	32	“ They gave their actual son to King Visio ’s sister . I took his place , and everyone that knew had to keep the secret . Visio studied me , and began conducting “
22839	22845	22846	22847	King Icar	32	” to replicate my power . ”
22866	22883	22884	22884	Trent	31	“ Those trials soon became dangerous , and they could no longer test them on me . ”
22978	22989	22972	22972	he	31	“ It 's time you accompany me to the Trials . ”
23294	23314	23315	23315	Sibier	31	“ I brought you these , as I noticed you did n’t eat the ones I gave you earlier . ”
23411	23419	23420	23420	he	31	“ What do you want from me ? ”
23443	23455	23456	23456	he	31	“ Sibier Sogni , the blasted king himself ordered your arrest , ”
23467	23476	23456	23456	he	31	“ They are requiring you for the Trials . ”
23552	23566	23567	23567	he	31	 I can not face the Trials . I must find my brother , "" " Werrin ’s expression hardened . " " Sibier 's gaze drifted to the door , the symbol of an escape he knew was unattainable . The cold metal of the shackles bit into his wrists as he pondered the gravity of Werrin 's proposition . Embracing the role of a spy meant abandoning any hope of reuniting with Ilyian , relinquishing their shared dreams , and betraying the legacy his parents died defending . But he would survive . Could he live with himself after paying such a cost ? His throat tightened , the decision looming over him like a shadow . " " His voice trailed off , uncertainty clouding his judgment . He felt a tear roll down from his eyes . I never told Ilyian goodbye . “
24440	24459	24435	24435	I	0	” he whispered . He felt as though those three words split his heart . Werrin leaned closer . “
24464	24550	24551	24551	We	796	” Suddenly , the door crashed open , unleashing a blast of cold air that cut through the chamber . The High Executioner loomed in the threshold . Sibier 's heart seized , every instinct screaming for him to flee , yet the chains mocked his desperation . Run , he thought . But his feet kicked against each other uselessly . His heart began to pound in his chest . Run . Werrin snapped to attention , his fatigue instantly replaced by rigid formality . " " he screamed , the plea a raw burst of his dwindling hope . The High Executioner regarded him with a chilling detachment , then turned to Werrin with a command cold as the grave . " " Werrin 's response was a terse nod , his expression unreadable . “

25953	25960	25961	25961	he	32	 Place him in the chair , "" " His gaze , fixed on Sibier ’s tormented figure , was tinged with a mix of fascination and something akin to respect . " " Heavens above , Trent cursed . Is this what Sibier feared the most ? Reliving the destruction that I had brought to his family ? Trent felt the grip of a cold specter tighten around his heart , and his guilt pooled inside of him like miasma . ibier 's desperate cry pierced the heavy air as he surged toward the apparitions of his family . But the scene morphed into a grotesque parody of his hopes ; his father faded into nothingness while his mother 's form twisted into the visage of the High Executioner . Sibier recoiled , his shock a mirror to Trent 's own heart - stopping realization . Could it be ? Am I what he fears most ? Trent felt as though he swallowed a sword . The mist was painfully accurate . He felt an eerie dissonance as if he were both spectator and participant , watching himself advance with a drawn blade against Sibier . The High Executioner 's relentless assault , a grim reflection of his own potential for destruction sickened him . Skies . He sickened him . It was getting hard to breathe , as Trent felt like the very air around him constricted in dismay . I need to do something . A fierce resolve ignited within him . It was clear Sibier stood no chance against the High Executioner . Without intervention , Sibier would meet his end here . Trent 's hand instinctively reached for his sword , the metal cold and grounding against his palm . The High Executioner advanced , striking Sibier with a brutal force that sent him sprawling to the ground . Trent nearly choked , a lump forming in his throat . It was time to act . For Sibier , for redemption , for all that still could be righted in this world gone awry . Heavens above . If Sibier were to die here , it might as well have been his own family . Growling , Trent drew his blade in a flash , slamming its pommel against the glass in a fluid motion . A web of fractures bloomed across the surface , and the panels shook against the pure force of his blow . But blast it ! That was n’t enough . His heart hammered against his ribs , each beat a ticking clock echoing Sibier 's dwindling chances . He attacked the glass again , his efforts more frantic . Time was slipping through his fingers like grains of sand , each moment pushing Sibier closer to the brink of death . The glass protested under the assault , cracking further under the relentless pommel , yet obstinately refusing to yield . Through the burgeoning network of fractures , Trent caught sight of his spectral double poised to deliver a fatal strike . It was a motion Trent knew all too well , a dance of death he had orchestrated more times than he cared to remember . This realization only fueled his desperation , his blows against the glass growing in intensity . The barrier , however , mocked him with its resilience , deepening his despair . Tears of frustration and fear welled in his eyes , spilling over as he unleashed a litany of curses . He was so close , yet impossibly far . Driven by a primal roar , Trent gathered every ounce of his strength , his entire being focused on the next strike . The pommel hit the glass with a thunderous impact ... only to be repelled . In that heart - stopping moment , as the High Executioner 's sword descended upon Sibier , time itself seemed to pause . Sibier , with a prayer on his lips , weakly raised his arms . And caught the blade.[v][w ] Trent felt his eyes widen , his mouth opening in awe . Did the stars do that ? He wondered . He stood transfixed as Sibier , with a defiance that seemed to draw from the very depths of his soul , wrested the blade from the High Executioner 's grasp and cast it aside . This display of resilience , of an indomitable spirit , was a beacon of hope in the darkness . For a moment , Trent once again dared to believe in miracles . Yet , Sibier was far from winning . Without the loss of momentum , the High Executioner ’s punch cracked against Sibier ’s jaw . Adrenaline kicked into Trent ’s veins . Time was running out . Stepping away from the glass , Trent drew a deep , steadying breath , and then abandoned all caution . In a fit of fury , he launched himself at the glass with the full force of his shoulder . The barrier buckled under his assault , a web of fractures spreading from the point of impact , the promise of breach tantalizingly close . Shard of glass cut into his skin , and he welcomed the pain . Flames of fury roared within , each pulse urging him forward . Just one more effort . One more time . Meanwhile , the mist 's assault on Sibier reached a merciless crescendo , its cruel kick shattering the last of the young fighter 's resistance . With triumph , his boots clamped Sibier ’s arm to the ground . And like hundreds of battles before , Trent finally felt everything come in focus . It was clear . His identity , his very essence , was inescapable . I am this kingdom ’s blasted rebellion leader ! With a resolve forged in the fires of countless battles , Trent recoiled like a spring and hurled himself with abandon . The glass shattered , shards glittering like stars in his peripheral vision as he rolled into the fray . Sword in hand , he rose like a phoenix from ashes , his blade an extension of his will . And his blade cut off the High Executioner ’s hand . The ethereal knife and hand dissipated into the air , but the mist lashed out in retaliation . The mist around his feet pricked him , feeling like little claws digging into his skin . Trent , the rebellion hero , barely even noticed . To him , pain was all too familiar . Trent 's heart pounded as he deftly stepped back , evading the High Executioner 's swift counterattack . Droplets of sweat formed a familiar veil on his face , and he welcomed the pressure and split - second decisions . A wistful realization struck him : It has been too long since I ’ve truly fought.[x ] The High Executioner , with a motion that seemed to defy reality , materialized a new sword from the very air . The blade was unmistakable — it was Karia 's , a sight that sent a cold wave of dread washing over Trent . The presence of her weapon here , in this nightmarish duel , twisted a knot of worry within him . How was Karia ? What had become of her ? The High Executioner wasted no time , pressing the attack and snapping Trent back to the grim present . Trent met the assault with a dancer 's grace , each parry and thrust a chorus of his years of training and battles fought . Every slash was precise . Every movement exact . Every swing calculated . This was his game . This was his battle . This was him . The rebellion leader . The hero who had once vanquished the High Executioner . He could do it again . Yet , this encounter bore an uncanny difference ; the High Executioner anticipated Trent 's every strategy , mirroring his tactics as though he was battling his own shadow . And when Trent dared to meet his adversary 's gaze , he was met with a reflection of himself , but twisted by a deep - seated hatred and loathing that he recognized all too well . It was a part of him he had always sought to bury deep within — something that lurked in the very chambers of his heart . An unearthly chill crawled through him : He was n’t fighting the High Executioner but he was confronting the darkest facets of his own soul , a manifestation of the man he feared he had become . Could this be who I am ? A spear of guilt impaled him as Karia 's sword , now wielded by this dark reflection , arced towards him . Warrior ’s only wielder ’s other blades when their owner had fallen … As he raised his sword instinctively to block the incoming strike , tears blurred his vision . The memory of Karia 's embrace , the warmth and safety of their last moment together , pierced through the chaos of the fight . Her defeat and her absence was a weight he bore , a silent accusation of his failure . Heavens above , he could still feel her tender arms wrapping around him , imagining the warmth of their last embrace … As the High Executioner lunged with lethal precision , Trent 's instincts surged to the forefront , pushing him to a frenzied dance of life and death . His attempt at a counter was swiftly rebuffed , the clash sending sparks of frustration igniting within him . Rage began to smolder in the depths of Trent 's soul , each memory of sacrifice for her , for the rebellion , fanning the flames into an inferno . The High Executioner was his enemy . And Trent was going to make him pay . Growling , he upended the High Executioner , his movements becoming a tempest of precision and fury . His assault was relentless , a barrage of strikes delivered with a cold , exacting vengeance . Vengeance for Karia . The trials , the very essence of his torment , became the target of his wrath . A cascade of hatred flowed through Trent ; towards the trials , towards King Icar , towards the entity that dared to mirror his darkest aspects . The loathing was palpable , a bitter taste in his mouth as he swept the High Executioner ’s weapon to the floor , rendering him defenseless . There was no pause , no hesitation in Trent 's resolve as he prepared the final strike . The eyes that met him were a reflection of his own , swirling with hatred and defiance . Yet , with a swift motion , his blade sang through the mist , severing the connection between them as the apparition dissolved into nothingness . For once , Trent wished he could have had the satisfaction of sinking his blade into the man ’s heart . Panting , the sword heavy in his grip , Trent caught sight of King Icar battling his own phantoms . Serves him right , he thought , a dark satisfaction in the king 's struggle . But the soft groan of Sibier drew Trent ’s attention back to him , breaking him from his daze . The kid was broken , his eyes glazed with exhaustion and pain . Blood caked his skin , and scratch marks covered him like he had been ripped apart by starved wolves . He was nearly dead . Even with the apparition defeated , a haunting vision of Karia lingered in his mind , a painful reminder of all he had lost , all he had failed to protect . With a heavy heart , he sheathed his sword and carefully lifted Sibier , the weight of responsibility anchoring him to his purpose . Not looking back , Trent took off running . _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ The Warleader Chapter Eleven

For that stupidity of yours , I am begrudgingly grateful , ”" "“ But you will never ever do something like that again . Understood ? ”" "“ I know you do n’t believe me , but the Skies themselves placed me here for a reason : they knew that I would do what no one else could . That I would do what no one else would . ”" "” Her face , contorted in pleading agony , was seared into his memory — the same face she had that night . Once again , Trent relived the absolute pain he had felt that moment he had chosen to save Icar . That moment he had betrayed her . “" "done?”[ar][as ] _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ Secrets of the Night Chapter [ at]Seventeen" "” She paused , as emotion filled her voice . “" "“ Eventually they caught me . ”" "” Karia ’s eyes flickered , her expression a storm of conflicting emotions . She touched her head , wincing slightly as her fingers came away sticky with blood . Her gaze hardened . “" "” Trent ’s fingers hesitated on the fragile flower , as it weighed heavily against him . He saw something detached in Karia ’s eyes , a hurt that was a fissure into her soul . It felt … it felt so familiar . It was that same look she had when she told him about her father ’s betrayal . But it also felt so different . Now that gaze , that pain , was directed towards him . Accusing him . Furious at him . Trent dropped the petal back into his pocket , folding his arms . “" "” He looked over his shoulder at his men , who stood awkwardly , their expressions a mix of unease and impatience . Trent could feel their discomfort , their silent judgment of Karia , the lingering distrust they held toward her . Despite wanting to keep this moment private , he knew he could n’t : these men did n’t trust him , but he owed her honesty now , even if it was in front of his — no , the kings’—men . “" "” he admitted , his voice steady but full of raw truth . “" "” He tried to smile , though it barely reached his eyes . “" "” Karia let out a short , bitter laugh , her eyes glinting with skepticism . She stepped back , pulling her hand away from Trent . “" "” she repeated , her voice laced with something between sarcasm and genuine sorrow . “" "” He held her gaze , unflinching . “" "” He rubbed his thumb against his palm , feeling the rough calluses but also the scars . “" "” Without another word , Karia grabbed him by the wrist , her grip firm and unyielding , yanking him forward . “" "”" "“ You soldiers , ”" "“ are under my command now . Capture the boy , or I ’ll kill every last one of you like the traitors you are . ”" "” For a moment , the room froze . The High Executioner ’s men faltered , their forward momentum halting . Their eyes darted between each other , then to the soldiers who now stood with Werrin . They outnumbered them , yes — but these were men who had bled together , who had fought side by side , who had trusted each other with their lives . Breaking that bond would n’t be as simple as drawing steel . Sibier ’s breath hitched in his chest . He watched in disbelief as Werrin ’s men shifted into a protective formation around him , shields of flesh and steel . They did n’t have to . None of them had to . Yet here they were , risking their lives for him . For him . Werrin smirked , a faint , almost imperceptible curve of his lips . He glanced at the soldier who had spoken , nodding slightly in approval . For the first time , Sibier felt a surge of what he felt when he saw Werrin with his family — admiration . This is the dream . These are the people I need for the dream . Seeing his men ’s hesitation , the High Executioner ’s face twisted with fury . “" "” Werrin scowled . “" "” He scoffed , dry from his throat , a rasping sound that held no fear . “" "” The High Executioner narrowed his eyes , venom filling his words . “" "” “" "” Werrin shot back , his voice rising . “" "” He stepped forward , his sword still raised but his words cutting sharper than any blade . “" "” The High Executioner punctuated every word . “" "” The tension in the room was suffocating , the kind that made every breath feel labored . Sibier could see it — the shifting stances of the High Executioner ’s men , their growing uncertainty . Some glanced toward Werrin , then back to Trent . The lines between sides were blurring . Karia stood silent , with one hand resting on the hilt of her sword . Her body was poised like a lion ready to strike . She stared at Werrin with daggers in her eyes , but her lips remained tight . And no one seemed to be paying attention to him anymore — or the door . Sibier ’s eyes darted between the warring figures and his path to freedom , his breaths shallow and quick . He began to inch toward the exit , moving slowly , careful not to draw notice . If I can just slip out now … His heart pounded in his ears . I can run . Find Ilyian . Hide . Just run . Werrin ’s voice boomed through the cavern . “" "” the captain spat . “" "“ When I return , I ’ll require proof that the King has discovered secrets to undo us . Else , I ’ll conduct the investigation myself . ”" "“ Terit , is the rope secure ? ”" "” Murmurs rippled through the crowd . A few faces lit up with cautious hope , but doubt lingered in amongst the entire group . “" "” Taking a deep breath , Sibier continued , feeling shaky . Do the stars condemn me for this ? Was what he said blasphemy ? He was n’t sure , but he had to press forward . “" "” Sibier ’s stomach dropped . “" "” he gasped . His voice faltered . “" "” His words however were too late : the crowd erupted in chaos . People shoved and screamed , fear and rage mixing . Hands clawed at Sibier , pulling at his hands and limbs . Someone grabbed the corner of his bag , yanking him . “" "” Sibier cried , kicking back . Someone yanked hard on the corner of his bag , and it tore open . Seaweed scattered across the ground , trampled underfoot . “" "” But his voice was lost in the commotion . The crowd surged and pushed , a wild , unrelenting beast . Sibier ’s pulse raced as he fought to stay upright . “" "” he shouted , his voice raw . “" "” But the chaos only deepened . Faces blurred into a frenzied mass . The press of bodies closed in , sweat and panic mingling into an oppressive heat . He scanned desperately for Karia , Yorin , Selean — anyone — but saw only a writhing sea of arms and desperate faces . “" "” Kingdom guards shouted , their shields battering through the mob . “" "“ Everyone must be able to come . Everyone must be invited . ”" "” She handed out a piece of dried seaweed to him . Shocked , Trent took the tiny bunch of seaweed from the girl . Then , she was out again . Frozen in place , Trent let the contagious feeling warm him . He was so close to breaking , but he had to save his family . There was something still in this world for him . He could feel it . Grabbing the last of the diapers , Trent shoved them down his trench coat . Sibier would need them , and even though Trent had to bring him back to the Trials , at least he could do this one service . He could reclaim a part of who he was . He strode out to find out who this person was the girl was talking about . It did n’t take long . He could hear the awe of the crowd the moment he stepped out of the door . As he turned down into the street , Trent saw what he never thought he would imagine . A crowd -- maybe thirty hundred people -- stood gathered around a boy standing on an empty fish crate . A hush had come over him , as they stood mesmerized by Sibier . It was easy to tell why the crowd had gathered . Sibier stood with his sleeves rolled up fulling exposing his curse . The crowd was stunned . They hung onto each of Sibier ’s words as he talked about how the stars had saved him , and how something new was coming . Something grand . Trent stepped closer , sticking to the shadows . The ocean breeze blew the stink of the crowd , smelling like dry fish and mildew . He eyes looked among those in the crowd , trying to read lips . “" "” one whispered . And then he spotted Karia . She just infront of Sibier , pushing back the crowd . Even from where he stood , Trent could make out the sagging darness beneath her eyes , and could see the tension in her shoulders . He knew that it was n’t the crowd giving her stress . Trent ’s heart sank . He wanted more than anything to go to her and ask what was bothering her . Deep inside , he knew it was him . Trent stepped a little closer , trying to get a better view of Karia . It was hard with the bustling of the crowd . Whispers muttered through them , but they did n’t seem excited , but doubtful . Trent ’s eyes met Karia ’s . Her face stiffened , and then she disappeared into the crowd . Skies , how am I ever going to earn her forgiveness ? He exhaled , feeling the cloth absentmindedly in his coat pocket . His mind went to Icar , to his family , to Karia and then back to Icar . Then the High Executioner strode forward . _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ Chapter Something[cd ] or Another A star in the sky shine the brightest when the night is at its Darkest" "“ Pardon me , sir , ”" "“ I ’m going to try to boil some of this to see if it could taste better . ”" "“ I will , ”" "” She choked , stifling sobs . “" "” She used to love Werrin ? Shem ? Momentarily , the despair inside shifted to let confusion through . Sibier furrowed his brow , still biting back tears . Werrin and Shem were dead . And it was his fault . How many people had died for him ? Too much ... He felt as though his boots were sinking into tar , dragging him down . The sorrow clung to him , rooted him firmly in place . It took too much to step out of it : he wanted to lay down and let the sorrow envelop him . Sibier squared his jaws , tensing . He could n’t do that . He could n’t let anyone else die . He could n’t lose himself to that tar . He had made a promise to his parents . He would do it . Clenching his fists , he felt his resolve harden . I would make sure of it . Pushing her emotions to the side , Karia steeled her voice . “" "” Selean cast her eyes to the dirt , secluding herself from the conversation as Sibier ’s and Karia ’s voices rose . “" "” Briefly , Sibier ’s mom and dad popped into his head . Quickly , he shoved them from his mind . He could n’t deal with that pain . Not now . A wave of regret splashed across Karia , as she glanced down in shame . Her voice curled with guilt , her tone battered . “" "“ Run ! ”" "“ You , Trent , ”" "“ are pathetic . Even with all your talent , it 's a shame you ca n’t even figure out when you are beaten . You lost to me years ago . Accept it . ”" "“ You ’ve never known how much hope can hurt . ”" "“ Hope breathes a battle in the hearts of every man , but it is family that carries the heart 's rhythm . ”" " and our apeasements would have failed " " it never gets easier " " How can I ? "
Karia: " Finish it . " "“ Trent , they ’re coming , ”" "“ TRENT ! ”" "“ WHAT ARE YOU WAITING FOR ! ”" "“ What are you doing , Trent ? ! ”" " Why , Trent ? " "“ Why ! "" "“ Why , Trent ? I trusted you ! ”" "“ No , ”" "“ No , please … ”" "“ You idiot , Trent . ”" "“ Please do n’t leave me ! ”" "“ Do n’t go , ”" "“ Please do n’t go ... ”" "“ You 're alive ! ”" "“ Trent , what have they done to you ? ”" "“ Why , ”" "“ Why did you do it ? ”" "“ Am I not family to you ? ”" "“ I always had . I ’m not sure if I should anymore . ”" "“ Go away , ”" "“ Please , leave me alone . ”" "“ No . ”" "“ You 're different , ”" "“ I love you Trent , but please go . ”" "“ What have you done[y][z ] ? ”" "“ Skies , it ’s good to be with you again , ”" "“ Let ’s go , ”" "“ but first I need to tell you something . ”" "“ Those guards you killed … ”" "“ Well , that one had pity for me , and he kept me updated on what he could in secret . He told me Selean is sick . ”" "“ She has the same thing your brother did , Trent . ”" " You 've been unconscious for nearly a day , " "“ You should rest . ”" "“ Do you ? ”" "“ Do you know what it feels like to be so close to achieving everything you ever wanted , then have it snatched away from you ? Do you know what it is like to lose what you love most ? ”" "“ You only live because of Trent ’s heart . He put his own family at risk to save you . He never did that for me . ”" "“ Who were your parents ? Tyrants in the kingdom ? ”" "“ No , ”" "“ He would n’t have . ”" "“ You know he is only trying to save his own family , ”" "“ King Icar is forcing him to do those things . ”" "“ I love him , Sibier , and he betrayed me also to save them . He could n’t let them die . ”" "“ You want to start another rebellion ? ”" "“ How could we possibly do that ? ”" "“ The people are broken . We lost . ”" "“ No fighting ? ”" "“ I ’ll give it a try . ”" "“ Her name is Karia . ”" "“ Two islands west of here used to be a rebel hideout . It will be an ideal place to establish a new community , and to build out of the ashes of the rebellion . ”" "“ Terit , this is n’t about rebellion . It ’s about survival . It ’s about giving people a chance to live , not just exist . ”" "“ We will only need equipment , ”" "“ Excuse me ? Girl ? ”" "“ Wait . ”" "“ Stay ”" "“ You ’re okay , ”" "“ With Werrin injured , I do n’t know if we can take both of the Darkened Dawn as prisoners anyways . ”" "“ Sibier — ”" "“ I ’m alright , ”" "“ We can at least take the man ’s cloak , ”" "“ We need to go . The Darkened Dawn will see the smoke soon . ”" "“ Sibier , help Werrin get out . ”" "“ Are you going to try to save him like you saved Icar ? ”" "“ This is for your own good , love . ”" "” Trent ’s heart went cold . His hand found the final switches , his resolve hardening as the weight of her words crushed down on him . He flipped off the last coolant . Then , with unholy determination , he flipped off everything except the Trials . The room ’s temperature began to rise , a suffocating heat that matched the turmoil inside him . His fingers trembled as they found the dial , but there was no hesitation as he turned it the rest of the way . Immediately , the instruments in front of him began to burn his hands , the heat searing his skin as the cooling systems failed . All the lights on the control board blinked out . Metal shrieked as it grinded metal , the sound of the Trials tearing themselves apart . Trent ’s breath caught in his throat as he watched the spectacle unfold . Flashes of lightning illuminated the scene in harsh , staccato bursts , casting monstrous shadows on the walls . The mist , now a churning maelstrom , tore through the man , twisting his flesh into something otherworldly — a purple film that shimmered and writhed like a living nightmare . Across the room , Karia ’s spectral face lingered for a moment longer , her expression locked in an eternal plea . And then , with a final , agonizing pull , the mist consumed her , dragging her into oblivion . The man ’s screams abruptly cut off . His eyes rolled back into his head . The torrential mist halted . His glow disappeared . The chamber fell into deathly silence . Everything stopped . The High Executioner stilled , his heart frozen in his chest . With unmistakably horror , he now watched the twitching fingers of the man ’s corpse . “" "“ What are you doing ? ”" "“ Humane ? We ’re not here to coddle them , Sibier . These people are dangerous . If you let him go , what ’s to stop him from running back to the Darkened Dawn and telling them exactly where we are ? ”" "“ And if he betrays us ? If this humane gesture gets us all killed ? ”" "“ We have to do it , Sibier , ”" "“ I do n’t like it , but we do n’t have a choice . ”" "“ No we do n’t — ”" "“ Yes , we do , ”" "“ We will let you go , ”" "“ but we need you to talk . ”" "“ That ’s just fine , ”" "“ We already know everything you know . ”" "“ We ’ve been following you for weeks , ”" "“ That ’s how we found you and your partner alone tonight . ”" "“ We know your schedule . Your meetings . Your contacts in the Darkened Dawn . We know about your parents , your siblings , and even about the girl you want to court . ”" "“ There ’s just one thing we do n’t know , ”" "“ You ’ll tell us , and we ’ll let you go . ”" "“ Let ’s start with the Trials to catch you up , ”" "“ Have you heard about the boy ? ”" "“ Yes , that ’s right . And you ’ve heard that they plan to take him to them as well ? ”" "“ I would n’t expect you to know that . After all , our spies never reported you in any of the inner - circle meetings . Anyways , at the tip of the Island Esther[au ] reaches into the depths . It did n’t take long for the Darkened Dawn to find a way down . ”" "“ Your leader was the first to do it . ”" "“ Stop wasting my time with your ignorance . No , the leader of the Darkened Dawn . ”" "“ You had an eventful day , ”" "“ I bet your overwhelmed . ”" "“ I remember when I had first felt that way , ”" "“ It was nearly four years ago . Back then , my family ran a rather successful toy store . My father was a skilled carver , and was often hired out by some of the wealthiest barons and dukes in the kingdom . ”" "“ Back then , I had everything I could have wanted for myself as I managed our store and delivered the toys . I noticed back then the kids who did n’t have any , and how they would look longingly at me as I passed on the street . Pretty soon , I started giving a few of the toys I was supposed to deliver to them , and would tell my father I had lost them . At first , he would shrug and make more . ”" "“ Why are you telling me this ? ”" "“ Because I thought you should know . Anyways , like I am stubborn today , I was stubborn back then . One of the daughters of the dukes saw that I was doing this told her father , who in turn threatened my father to ‘ get a reign on his devilish daughter . ’ ”" "“ My father in turn demanded that I stop giving away toys . But I would n’t . ”" "“ The next time I gave away toys , the duke ordered me arrested . I remember the kingdom guard 's pounding on our door , and my father answered . I can still see the grim expression that came across his face . Sibier , ”" "“ he did n’t even have tears in his eyes when he handed me over . “" "“ I waited in a cell for what must have been a week before the Baron and my father came down . His head was heavily bandaged , and I tried to tell him I was sorry . ”" "“ He did n’t care . The Baron suggested I be taken to the Trials for my rebellion , and all my father said was ‘ I agree ’ . He did n’t even fight for me . ”" "“ That ’s for sure . Luckily for me though as the guards were taking me to the Trials , it had been when Trent first started to rescue those sent there . I will never forget how he burst from the shadows , and saved my life . I had nowhere to go , and so I decided I would help him . ”" "“ So I do know what it feels like to be a prisoner Sibier . Sometimes I fear I have my Dad ’s ruthlessness , but the Darkened Dawn had answers we needed to know . ”" "“ Thanks . ”" "“ The man did n’t know exactly . He mentioned it was their key to overthrowing the king , ”" "“ If we could figure out what this ‘ resurrection ’ means and discover before they do , it might give us an edge . ”" "“ Of course I did . I already have a plan to raid it too . ”" "“ We might , ”" "“ Sibier , ”" "“ open your eyes . ”" "“ I ’m ready , ”" "“ Tonight is a perfect night for this raid , ”" "“ The full moon , the stars — like they ’re lighting the way for us . ”" "“ But it ’s perfect because I ’m with you . ”" "“ The flower is my promise . We ’ll go together , and we ’ll come back together . ”" "” he ordered , his voice sharp , but his gaze was already drifting back to Karia . He sheathed his sword , but his heart was still pounding for a different reason . He remembered those condemning words she spoke to him in the priso[bk]n : Am I not family to you ? I had trusted you … I ’m not sure I should anymore . Go Away ! Leave me alone . Trent did n’t know seeing her again would rip at his heart . “" "” he breathed , his voice almost breaking . “" "” she demanded , the edge in her tone unmistakable . “" "” Trent raised his eyebrows , taken aback by her brazen bitterness . “" "” Karia grimaced . “" "” Karia interrupted him , spitting her very words like ice . “" "” Trent ’s heart stopped , his blood freezing in his veins . The air was thick with tension as those words hung heavy , the silence stretching between them . Slowly , his hands inched once again to the flower in his pocket , and tenderly lifted it out . Its petals were crushed and the stem bent , but Trent held it out to her as if it were a jewel . “" "” he began , his voice quieter , softer . “" "” He did n’t know what else to say . Karia ’s gaze dropped to the flower , her eyes lingering on it before lifting to meet his . There was a flicker of something — pain , maybe even longing — but it was buried beneath layers of guarded distance . She still held her finger to his nose . Trent swallowed , words tumbling out before he could stop them . “" "” He broke off , struggling to hold her gaze . “" "“ Trent , ”" "“ Trent ’s resolve wavered for a fraction of a second . A flicker of doubt flashed in his eyes , but it was swallowed by a surge of anger . His composure shattered like glass , and his voice exploded with raw , unchecked fury . “" "“ Werrin … ”" "“ Trent ! ”" "“ Trent ? ”" "“ At what cost , Trent ? ”" "“ Would you sacrifice me to save your family ? ”" "“ Would you ? ”" "“ So now you like being Icar ’s puppet ? ”" "“ Like what , Trent ? ”" "“ Like a real monster ? Lying to the people you love and killing their friends ? ”" "“ You ’re not the man I fought for , ”" "“ And you ’re not the man I loved . ”" "“ Karia , wait ! ”" "“ I ’ll save you Trent , ”" "“ But I ca n’t until you kill the High Executioner . ”" "“ Sibier ! Are you here ? We need to go ! ”" "“ Sibier ! ”" "“ We need to go ! ”" "“ We ’re here . ”" "“ Is he okay ? ”" "“ Is he ok ? ”" "“ The head wound is n't bad , ”" "“ He just needs to snap out of the shock . ”" "“ They went back to the hideout , ”" "“ Terit stormed off to grab more seaweed so he would n’t be hungry . ”" "“ I agree . ”" "“ Do you have any more of that green stuff ? ”" "“ We need to talk . ”" "“ My name is Karia . ”" "“ Selean . ”" "“ Can she be trusted ? ”" "“ Good . ”" "“ How many men do you have here ? ”" "” Sibier wanted to comfort her , to tell her it was alright , but he could n’t . He was mad — frustrated even . She did n’t come to tell him that Shem and Werrin had died , but instead requested that the people in his community give up their lives for a useless war . Requesting that his people give away their first real opportunity . She was requesting beggars to aid those who had scoffed at their need . To fight their war . That is why she came , and her audacity stung Sibier . No , he was n’t going to comfort her . Skies , he was mad . He kept his voice even , doing his best to ferret out all anger . “" "” He left no room to question . Turning on his heels , Sibier stalked away . After all , he needed to make sure Ilyian did n’t choke on the moss ball Swine had given him . _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ Chapter Twenty - Eight A New Chapter" "“ Intruders ! ”" "“ Apricots , ”" "“ We ’re ready , let ’s go . ”" "“ This way men ! GO GO GO ! ”" "“ Get out ! ”" "“ Trent , get your men out now ! ”" "“ Sibier , you can only escape it , ”" "“ You can not fight it ! ”" "“ Trent , your men are here . Where is the heti ? ”" "“ Sibier , you idiot … ”" "“ Trent , I still love you . I ’ve always had . ”" "“ Heavens above , ”"
Skies: "“ I … I loved you ! Why did you betray me ? ”" "“ Brother[e ] ? ”" "” Karia ’s face softened , but her lips remained pressed into a tight line . The vulnerability in her eyes was fleeting , replaced by a wary bitterness . She lowered her arm . Trent took a shaky breath , gathering his courage , and placed the flower in her hands , wrapping his fingers around hers . “" "“ Get out of my way ; my quarry is n’t with you . ”"
Selean: "“ You should have done it , ”" " Brother , no ! " "“ We do n’t know because this idiot wo n’t tell us , ”" "“ I wo n’t leave my brother , ”" "“ She was going to die , but then King Icar showed up with this vial of strange medicine . If he had n’t given it to her , Selean would already be dead . ”" "“ You saved her , Trent . ”" "“ No , I did n’t . I ’ve condemned us all to lives of misery . ”" "“ Let me at him ! ”" "“ Here , ”" "“ you ’re shivering . ”" "“ No , ”" "“ Luckily the guards broke it apart quickly . ”" "“ He ’s serious . Believe it , ”" "“ I am not His pet ! ”" "“ Stop ! ”" "“ You do n’t know him , ”" "“ Please , do n’t kill my brother ! ”" "“ Sibier ! ”" "“ The Survivor bested him . Under his lead , we will forge a new kingdom . ”" "“ Who is it ? ”" "“ I came back here , did n’t I ? ”" "“ Why did you have to cut off his hand ! ”" "“ He killed my family , Selean . ”" "“ So ? ”" "“ I would ’ve killed him if it was n’t for you-- ”" "“ Then you 're no better than he is , ”" "“ Why are you here ? ”" "“ Your wasting what you got . Crush the Kingdom with this rebellion . ”" "“ I left my family to finish what my brother started . I hate him for betraying the kingdom , but he saved me the blasted fool . I owe it to him to save him now from the kingdom , and to burn it all down . He deserves vengeance . I deserve it too . ”" "“ I … This is n’t a rebellion ! ”" "“ Then why did I bother spreading the word to get so many people here ? ”" "“ We have everything we need . People are coming . We have Karia to lead us . ”" "“ You said you wanted to ‘ make things right between us ’ , ”" "“ Well this is it . Stop being such a blasted coward and free this people ! ”" "“ You are a lot like my brother . ”" "“ Swine is doing it again , ”" "“ I ca n’t believe you just wandered to find me , Sibier . Swine may be energizing the people here , but he was not the one who saved my life . ”" "“ This is something I could get used to , ”" "“ Me too . ”" "“ What ’s wrong ? ”" "“ It 's time , ”" "“ You got this , ”" "“ Are you ready to die ? ”" "“ Selean , today is not the day you die . ”" "“ Thank you for coming back . ”" "“ What do you mean ? ”" "“ I will . ”" "“ Sibier ! ”" "“ For Ilyian , ”" "“ I ’m not leaving Sibier ! ”" "“ No ! Stop , ”" "“ Do n’t do this please , ”" "“ I love him like I love you . ”" "“ Do n't go , ”" "“ Its okay . ”" "“ Promise me Selean that you will love Ilyian as I do . ”" "“ Please , Selean . Promise you will … ”" "“ I will , ”" "“ You are n’t my brother , ”" "“ You ’re … you ’re … you ’re like the rest of them . ”" "“ You 're worse than even Icar . You are n’t , ”" "“ You are n’t family . ”" "“ Sister , would he be proud ? ”" "“ Yes , ”" "“ Sibier ’s pride shines down from the stars . ”" "“ Ilyian , I am also proud . Sibier would want nothing more than you to lead this community . ”"
Trent ’s mother: "“ Do n’t you see his pain ? ”" "“ Do n’t add to it . ”"
her: "“ Trent . ”" "“ Please , Trent , ”" "“ Do n’t start a fight here , ”" "“ Come on ! ”" "“ Sibier was only nineteen when he found me . He was only nineteen when he started the community , when he brought back hope to the kingdom , ”"
Their mother: " It is not your choice to make , Selean . "
She: "“ It ’s not your fault , brother . You gave it your best . ”" "“ I ’m sorry , ”" "“ The cost was too great for me to pay . ”" "“ It ’s alright . ”" "“ Oh brother , ”" "“ you ’ve grown rugged ! ”" "“ We have been treated ... very well . ”" "“ Come , I want to show you something . ”" "“ Are you coming , Trent ? Icar only gave me a day with you . ”" "“ No , it 's not that , ”" "“ Skies ! Icar … ”" "“ Race you there , ”" "“ See , ”" "“ You look much better now . ”" "“ Put it behind you Trent , ”" "“ You are just going to have to wait and see , are n’t you ? ”" "“ It 's magnificent , Trent , ”" "“ is n’t it ? ”" "“ Does n’t this make you want to keep going , despite all the malice in the world ? ”" "“ Does it matter ? ”" "“ What ’s done is done . What ’s important is that you do n’t give up . A wise rebellion leader once told me , ‘ You are only defeated once you ’ve surrendered your hope . ’ ”" "“ No , they are n’t . ”" "“ Icar killed them , did n’t he ? You were going to say ‘ before they were killed , ’ were n’t you ? ”" "“ No , they are n’t dead , ”" "“ But Selean would be if it was n’t for the kingdom ’s help . ”" "“ Trent , she almost died from the necfas — just like our brother . The doctors are always with her , and mom and dad could n’t bear to leave her side . ”" "“ Sibier , ”" "“ the Heavens teach us that we must be good to everyone . ”" "“ Sibier , ”" "“ you know about the sense — that feeling deep inside you — that scriptures speak so much about . That sense to do good , that pull towards kindness , is the real you . You are not anything else . You are not the labels the guards degrade you with . You are not your body . You are n’t even your thoughts whether good or bad . Sibier , that sense is you — it is the soul that the stars have made your body for . ”" "“ Sibier , ”" "“ never betray that sense . Never betray your soul . Never betray who you truly are . ”" "“ Please … leave me alone , ”" "“ No , ”" "“ Why are you out here ? This is n’t where people live . ”" "“ Same here , ”" "“ You … remind me of my brother , ”" "“ Where is he now ? ”" "“ I … I do n’t know , ”" "“ Selean . ”" "“ Are you ok . ”" "“ I should be aking you that , Trent . I ca n’t imagine what Icar has made you do … ”" "“ I do n’t want to dwell on that . ”" "“ I ’m proud of you . ”" "“ ... but for yours to come , you have to listen to Icar . ”" "“ Trent , horrible things are coming . Icar showed us . He is going to need your help . ”" "“ What-- What do you mean ? ”" "“ Trent , ”" "“ If you do n’t succeed here , it 's not just us that will die . The whole kingdom will . ”" "“ Trent , its what he would want . ”" "“ Listen son , ”" "“ Listen son , ”"
the guard: "“ Apologies , my King , ”" "“ These scum do n’t deserve respect . ”"
His: "“ ... Trent ? ”" "“ The rebellion scattered after hearing your death ... ”" "“ But with you back we might have a chance ! You ’re alive ! ”" "“ What are you doing with him ? ”"
the father: "“ TRAITOR ! ”" "“ Sibier , get your brother and run . ”"
his: "“ Save yourself . Save Ilyian . Save our dreams . ”" "“ Please , ”" "“ let me live . ”" "“ Iven , ”" "“ you are sure that we need not to kill the kid ? Roc thirsts to make this as painful as possible . ”"
The Vagrant: "“ Look at that slithering soldier eating in our faces just to mock us , ”" "“ With the six of us taking shifts , ”" "“ we are able to collect enough blasted seaweed for thirty people in a week in a single day . We could sustain a few more people than what we have . ”"
the bigger vagrant: "“ We should fight him , Terit , ”" "“ Take our food back . ”"
Terit: "“ It ’s pointless , Yorin , ”" "“ We either starve or die at the tip of his sword . ”" "“ What are you going to do kid ? ”" "” Yorin whispered reverently , only for Terit to interrupt . ¨You can get us more food ? ”" "“ Yorin spent too much time in jail reading from those dilapidated words , ”" "“ anyways , he ’s a little gone up here , ”" "“ To the depths with it all though , because we ’re in … but what 's the plan , kid ? ”" "“ Thank the heavens ! You 're safe ! ”" "“ At no expense to us , ”" "“ The child practically ate the entire bag of food by himself . ”" "“ I know who she is . Why is she here ? She does n’t belong . ”" "“ Yeah , I was wondering when you would fulfill that , ”" "“ I did n’t sign up to join a rebellion . ”" "“ So , a rebellion , ”" "“ And what makes you think we can do it ? What makes you so sure we wo n’t fail like that old , blasted rebellion of yours ? ”" "“ Girl , we do n’t have any materials , or tools to make equipment , people , or even blasted food . ”" "“ Finally , ”" "“ What a blasted mess this is , ”" "“ This place has got fifty rooms and not a single blasted bathtub . ”" "“ And this view ? ”" "“ Blocked by all this blasted seaweed . And it smells like — ”" "“ Hmm , back to the fancies of crazed old men . ”" "“ No , ”" "“ Of course it is , kid ! Skies , get to it already ! We ’re hungry here . ”" "“ Sibier ? ”" "“ You on ? ”" "“ Great , ”" "“ Hurry up then ! ”" "“ There was this much down there ? ”" " Smells as pungent as the moss , " "“ Well , if the kid can do it , why not ? ”" "“ Tastes worse than it smells , ”" "“ You think we could be the next Darkened Dawn ? ”" "“ How kid ? ”" "“ If man come unto the Stars , then the Stars will Show him his weakness that he may learn humility ”" "“ Allow me , ”" "“ Only fair that the weapon that took Yorin will also take him . ”" "“ To the depths with you . ”" "“ Do n’t kill him ! ”" "“ Get out of my way girl , ”" "“ This is working , Sibier , ”" "“ Sibier , there is something else we need to talk about . ”" "“ It 's my fault Yorin ’s dead , is n’t it . ”" "“ I should have been the one to pick up your fallen sword . Yorin deserved his life — I do not . ”" "“ If I had your power , I could have saved him . ”" "“ It is my fault , Sibier ! ”" "“ It 's because he saw something good within you . ”" "“ You ’re a fool Sibier . Any reason Yorin stayed around me is because the idiot has a blasted bleeding heart . He could n’t abandon anyone , that blasted man . ”" "“ Yeah , and see where that got us , ”" "“ All I ever did was a facade . Fake , with no real value . Skies ! Anyone can talk — anyone can curse — but not everyone can be the friend Yorin was . ”" "“ Then make Yorin ’s sacrifice worth it . ”" "“ Sibier ! ”" "“ I will not pass this chance to be heroic again , Siber . Yorin died fighting ; I will not step away . ”" "“ Sibier , they respect you . You take them to safety . Let us buy you some time . ”" "“ And I 'll give them a taste of the blasted depths . ”" "“ For Yorin . ”"
Ilyian: "“ Do you think we ’ll survive this ? ”" "“ Where ’s Ma ? ”" " he implored , eyes locked on Werrin , searching for any sign of mercy . " " Biting his lip , Sibier leaned forward , searching Werrin for any sign of hope . Yet , something weighed the captain down : his eyes sagged , and his movements were slow . “
23725	23730	23673	23673	Ilyian	46	” he spoke softly . “
23746	23769	23675	23675	he	46	” Sibier nodded : he knew this already , but it did n’t matter . He could n’t go to the trials . “
23772	23783	23675	23675	he	46	” Werrin sighed , placing his fist on the table . “
23808	23869	23795	23796	The King	186	” Like that , Sibier realized , it 's over . He felt his blood run cold . Silently , he wrestled with the cuffs around his legs , glancing at the door behind the captain . He might have better luck in the storm … [o ] Werrin looked to the ceiling , thinking . Cautiously , he spoke . “
23883	23889	23890	23890	I	0	” Sibier froze . What ? “

23932	23977	23921	23922	a spy	787	” Sibier blurted . It would n’t give him the rank he needed , but he would survive . He could find another way to accomplish his dream , but heavens above , he needed to live . And this seemed like his chance . " "“ Si ! ”" "“ Momma , ”" "“ Do n’t leave ... ”" "“ I miss Momma , ”" "“ I miss Dadda too . I want them home ! ”" "“ I know , ”" "“ I see them when I sleep . ”" "“ Mooss ! ”" "“ Mooss ! ”" "“ I want to make things right between us , ”" "“ I ’m hurting Selean . This does n’t feel right . ”" "“ I ’m only nineteen . Why do they want me as a king ? ”" "“ This is your mantle to carry , Ily . ”"
He: "“ Go your way . ”" "“ It is Captain Werrin to you not sir , ”" "“ Do not disrespect me again . ”" "“ David never fought again after that . It broke him . ”" "“ Help me ! ”" "“ Skies , ”" "“ In exchange for what ? ”" "“ You mean the rumors ? The boy who survived ? The one we ’re supposed to catch for tribute ? ”" "“ Oh , ”" "“ Show me , ”" "“ Come inside , ”" "“ But why did you come here … instead of going directly to the Master ? ”" "“ How ’d you get that cloak ? ”" "“ We ca n’t run . They ’ve blocked the exit . Stand and fight . ”" "“ Captain … ”" "“ On every coin there are two sides . One is hidden , and the other is shown . ”" "” “" "” Sibier whirled around , scanning the crowd . His heart thudded in his chest . “" "” The crowd stirred uneasily , confusion and anger spreading like poison . “" "” Sibier shouted , his voice desperate . “" "” “" "” “" "” another voice called out . A wiry man pushed to the front , waving a parchment in his hand . “" "“ Get up , you urchin , ”" "“ I ’m Yorin , ”" "“ Urchin , give up . You have already lost , ”" "“ Let us be . ”"
Werrin: "“ You get my scraps , urchin . ”" "“ You ’re bluffing . ”" "“ I could use more men like you , ”" "“ But your threat is a lie , kid . ”" "“ Here . ”" "“ Be back here tomorrow at first light , and I ’ll bring your enlistment papers to sign . You wo n’t have to worry about starving any more . ”" "“ Sibier . ”" "“ I had heard that the High Executioner had finally visited the last of the Sogni . ”" "“ How did you escape ? ”" "“ I was there , ”" "“ David lost his closest friend that day . In his sorrow , he became a tempest of rage , and he had that same look in his eyes that you do . ”" "“ Welcome to the team , Sibier . ”" "“ You came , ”" "“ I had hoped you would n’t . ”" "“ Not a word , ”" "“ I ’m sorry , kid , ”" "“ Who were you talking to kid ? ”" "“ And if you scream , I ’ll rip your heart right out . ”" "“ I offered you my help , did n’t I ? But by the stars above you ended up at the Trials , ”" "“ How did you do it ? How did you escape ? ”" "“ What would happen if I said no ? ”" "“ Kid , I do n’t know how you survived those blasted Trials , but I ’m not going to help you start a rebellion . You ’re too idealistic for a realist world . ”" "“ And you are going to do that by waging war on the Darkened Dawn ? ”" "“ You are out of your mind ! ”" "“ Not even the kingdom can regulate them anymore ! ”" "“ I have two daughters , ”" "“ I give them half my food each day , and still they do n’t get enough to eat . ”" "“ Kid , it 's impossible . I ’ve spent my whole career trying to thwart them . ”" "“ Let 's give him a proper burial , should we ? ”" "“ Whether this man ’s ash becomes a star in the heavens or sinks to the bottom of the ocean , he had fought well . ”" "“ If you place him there , the stalks will burn hot enough to send his ash heavenward ”" "“ No , we will let it burn . The Darkened Dawn needs this . ”" "“ Sibier , ”" "“ Do not question me . This food would never have reached the people . ”" "“ I ’ve waited a long time for this , ”" "“ We got him , ”" "“ Master ”" "“ You expect us to risk the security of our tribute , ”" "“ by traveling all that way at night ? You ’re a fool . ”" "“ Are you always this shortsighted ? What if it was intercepted ? ”" "“ I — ”" "“ Do n’t , ”" "“ Get the others manning this storehouse . I want everyone prepared to help us escort the Tribute to the Master . No excuses . No delays . ”" "“ Alright , start running , ”" "“ HELP ! ”" "“ The Rebellion ’s come here for the — ”" "“ We found it . ”" "“ Sibier . ”" "“ The key . ”" "“ Sibier , get out of the way and let my men work . ”" "“ Go lock the entrance , ”" "“ Make sure no one from the Darkened Dawn comes this way . ”" "“ Use this ! ”" "“ Blast it ! ”" "“ Sibier ! ”" "“ Sibier ! ”" "“ What … what in the depths were you doing , Sibier ? ”" "“ Sibier ! ”" "“ The boy , ”" "“ is already under my command . ”" "“ I ’m not letting you have him . And if you attack me again , ”" "“ we ’ll fight . We ’ll gang up , and we will kill you . ”" "“ Even if you managed to kill me , ”" "“ Icar would have you all hanged for treason . You ca n’t win that fight , Captain . ”" "“ Icar would celebrate us for killing the rebellion leader you are , ”" "“ You are n’t the High Executioner . We do n’t follow you . ”" "” The High Executioner 's eyes locked with Werrin ’s . “" "” The words hung in the air as Werrin fumbled for a response , gritting his teeth . For the first time , Sibier saw a crack in the captain ’s resolve — not a weakness , but of uncertainty . Sibier ’s heart raced as Trent took another step toward him , his movements slow and deliberate , blocking the only path towards escape . The tension in the room was suffocating , each breath Sibier took feeling like it might shatter the fragile balance . Then Werrin lunged . And the High Executioner became a tempest of steel . His sword met Werrin ’s with a deafening crash , the force of the blow echoing through the cavern . He spun , pivoting on his heel with a grace that did n’t match his bulk , redirecting Werrin ’s blade to the ground . The captain stumbled , his feet skidding on loose gravel as the High Executioner loomed over him . Sibier sprinted for the door . Sibier ’s breaths came fast and shallow , his feet pounding against the stone floor as though he were separate from his own body . He felt mechanical , his legs moving out of instinct rather than will . Just run . Just run . In a swift move , the High Executioner broke Werrin ’s defense , sending the captain ’s blade skittering across stone . The captain stumbled back , falling to one knee . Sibier froze mid - stride , his heart screaming in his chest . The door was only feet away , just within reach , but the sight of Werrin on the ground , unarmed and vulnerable , rooted him in place . He saw the High Executioner raise his sword for the killing blow , the same cold , mechanical precision he had witnessed in his nightmares . In the back of his mind , he saw his father under that blade . I have to do something ! Sibier ’s breath hitched . He reached for the knife in his scabbard , but he came up empty . Once again , he did nothing to save the captain who had sacrificed himself for him . The High Executioner ’s blade came down . Then Karia burst forward , her blade meeting the High Executioner 's in a thunderous crash . The sound jolted Sibier , snapping him out of his paralysis . “" "” Karia shouted over her shoulder , her voice raw and urgent . Her blade quivered against the High Executioner 's unyielding strength , her teeth bared in defiance . “"
My: "“ My name is Yorin , ”" "“ Terit , ”" "“ My name is Terit . ”" "“ Please ! ”" "“ My husband ’s fishery has run dry . ”"
Yorin: "“ The one blessed by the stars … ”" "“ Who are you ? ”" "“ scriptures , ”" "“ Who ’s there ? ”" "“ What ’s going on then ? You rarely wake a man unless there ’s trouble or ... ”" "“ You ’re not mixed up with the Darkened Dawn , are you ? ”" "“ I 'm just trying to do what 's best for us , for all of us . ”" "“ Kid , we did n’t think you were coming back , ”" "” “" "“ Can you watch Ilyian for a bit ? I need some fresh air . ”" "“ Consider him safe and sound until you return , ”" "“ May you grow up to see the stars light , ”" "“ SIBIER ! ”" "“SIBIER ARE YOU ALRIGHT ? ”" "“ You ’ll only get yourself arrested . ”" "“ Sibier is the prophesied ! You ca n’t take him . ”" "“ Are you going to stop me ? ”" "“ Yes . ”" "“ Because he has treated me like family . ”" "“ messias ”" "“ messias ”"
The High Executioner: " Please stop ! " "“ Step aside , Captain . ”" "“ I do n’t want to have to kill you . You ’re a good man . ”" "“ You 're out of time , ”" "“ Trent STOP ! ”" "“ Go to the depths , you idiot ! ”" "“ Skies , forgive me . ”" "“ The kid deserves to drown in the depths , ”" "“ For you , Selean . ”" "“ For you , Sasha . ”" "“ For you , mom . Dad . ”" "“ For you , Trent . ”" "“ Do n’t tell me what to do ! ”"
Captain Werrin of the 7th district: "” “"
We: " he said , masking his surprise with respect . The High Executioner only grunted , keeping the hood drawn over his face . He brushed past Werrin , fixing Sibier with a gaze that felt as if it pierced through to his soul . The High Executioner appeared almost as a ghoul as he neared , and Sibier 's mind reeled with haunting memories of his parents ' final moments . Their screams echoed in his ears , their loss igniting a primal fear within him . Skies ! He could hear his father ’s scream . He could see his mother drool blood . His fingers clawed at his skin as he watched his father get kicked again and again . He had felt so helpless then … Run . Grimacing , he squirmed against his restraints , a futile attempt to distance himself from the approaching figure . With heavy footfalls , the High Executioner advanced , and Sibier could smell his breath . It smelt like his father ’s blood . Sibier snapped . Panic overtook him , and in a moment of desperation , he toppled from his chair , his body convulsing in terror . " " His voice was a raw , fractured plea , his limbs flailing wildly in a frantic bid for freedom . Sibier 's mind was a tumultuous sea of terror , each nightmare crashing into him with the force of a tempest . He envisioned his mother , bound and helpless , her cries of anguish merging with the sinister laughter of the Darkened Dawn . And there , orchestrating the torment , was Trent , his presence a shadowy specter haunting Sibier 's every thought . Desperation clawed at his heart . There has to be a way out ! Run . Yet , he was trapped . Escape seemed as distant as the stars . The cold , unyielding pressure of the High Executioner 's boot against his back anchored him to the harsh reality of the stone floor . Air struggled to find its way to his lungs as panic set his body to tremble , his cries for freedom echoing off the uncaring walls . Heavens above , help me ! But his chains remained tight , and the High Executioner only pressed harder . In a frenzy , Sibier clashed his shackles against the stone , his eyes wild with fear . " "” Karia added bluntly . At that , Yorin ’s eyes widened , but Terit seemed unfazed . To him , it must have been another dream lost among the stars . “" "” he mumbled , “" "” Karia frowned , her frustration clearly visible . “" "” he mocked , shaking his head . “" "” For a moment , Karia ’s expression cracked . Her lips trembled , the way they always did when she was holding back tears , and Trent ’s heart ached to pull her into an embrace . When she spoke , her voice was barely a whisper , fragile and uncertain . “" "” he said , his words both a threat and a promise . He raised his blade slightly , meeting the High Executioner ’s men with a glare . “" "” Sibier balked . What ! So much was going so well for his community right now ; he was n’t going to throw that all away ! In the end , the solution did n’t come from overthrowing the government , but learning to live apart from it . So far , the kingdom ignored them , and so Sibier ignored the throne . No need in throwing away any lives . No one else needed to join his parent ’s sacrifice . Shem ’s and Werrin ’s sacrifice . Skies , so many had died already . Karia continued , sensing Sibier ’s surprise . “" "” “" "” Sibier rejected . “" "” he gestured with his arms to the rebel base . “" "” Karia ’s jaw dropped . “" "” Sibier screamed , pumping his fist . “" "” The crowd cheered , voices lifting high into the sky . Many of them had spent years rotting on the streets , waiting for an opportunity like this : to strike back , to make something out of their lives . And now Sibier offered it to them . But in the back of his mind , he still felt it . The foreboding anxiety — the fear that they would lose everything . Wars came with a heavy cost , and Sibier doubted he had enough to pay it . But as he looked back into the crowd — seeing the fearful men , the quivering vagrants and broken warriors all standing together , tall and defiant — Sibier felt his confidence surge . Maybe they did have enough . He rolled back both sleeves , revealing his curse . A gasp snaked through the crowd , shock rolling up their faces . They were n’t expecting this . “"
It: "“ You may call me Death . ”" "“ Nooo ! ”" "“ You burn our tribute and I will kill every person in this kingdom ! ”" "“ Please . ”" "“ You ’re next . ”" "“ You should n’t have burned the food , ”" "“ Rest assured that tonight your brother dies at my hands . ”"
you: " he said quietly , almost to himself . "
the syndicate member: "“ Your position as High Executioner is pleasing to our masters Trent , and so we will show you mercy . Give us the boy , and we will let Karia live . ”"
somebody else: "” Sibier felt his heart drop at the question , yet it resonated deep inside of him . “"
everybody: "” he reminded her , but he began to wonder if it was a mistake recruiting Terit in the first place . “"
Someone: "” Karia warned , “" "” Sibier blinked , unsure of how to respond . Skies , he had never considered the risk of betrayal . It would be easy for someone to turn against them , but why would they ? What threat did they pose ? Yet , despite his rationale , Karia ’s words left a sour taste in his mouth . These days , some people would do anything for simply a meal . Leaning away from Sibier , Karia continued to explain . “" "“ You . ”" "“ Stop ! ”"
them: "” Terit scoffed , his expression a mask of disdain . “" "” Karia sniffed , fighting back tears . Despite being only twenty - two , the warrior had the loving tenacity of a mother : her compassion far exceeded what Sibier ever expected . “"
They: "” Yorin muttered softly , but Karia spoke over him . “" "“ I want my family back . ”" "“ They ’re dead . ”" "“ Brothers , we are so much more ! Today we prove that to the kingdom ; today we show them what we truly are ! “" "“ Will you take us back to save the kid ? ”"
Her: "“ Are you coming ? ”" "“ You ’ll see , ”" "“ What do you want ? ”"
Stiffly: "“ And can you bring the other one ? ”"
Their: "“ Papa ! ”" "” Sibier grew quiet , almost deadly with reminiscence . “"
You: "“ We found a way to traverse the depths ? ”" "“ I thought ... they always came to us . ”" "“ Orion ? ”" "” Karia stared at him , her gaze intense and searching . The silence stretched between them , her expression wavering as she looked down at the crushed flower in her hands . For a long , breathless moment , she said nothing , and Trent ’s heart pounded with a mixture of fear and anticipation . Finally , she spoke , her voice a mere whisper . “" "” she said , the word hanging in the air like something precious and fragile . But then , her eyes widened in sudden realization , a jolt of urgency snapping her out of the moment . “" "” Trent blinked , bewildered by the abrupt change . “" "“ You ’ve never fought before , ”" "” he said , nodding his head toward Karia who glared back at him . “" "” He turned to the High Executioner ’s men , his voice rising with conviction , as though daring them to defy their leader . “" "” The High Executioner ’s face darkened . “" "” He spoke evenly , somehow containing the emotion so close to bursting . “"
The Darkened Dawn: "“ I meant to send word to the Master . Not travel there . ”" "“ Then just the equipment will be necessary . Well done , Iven . ”" "“ but we will find them . ”" "“ You ca n’t Sibier — the Heti wo n’t die . We ’ve hit it with swords ... blast it Sibier ! You ’ll get yourself killed ! . ”"
one of the men: "“ Did you hear that ? ”" "“ Where ’d they go ? ”"
one voice: "“ Heavens above , they ’re escaping around the bend ! ”"
The Rebellion: "” “" "” Trent muttered as he swung . The victim did n’t even have time to draw her weapon . Not far behind Trent , his men surged out from the forest , their voices echoing his cry as they swept into the valley like a tidal wave . Karia had already seized a fallen weapon , her stance shifting into a familiar readiness . The last two cultists glanced at each other , outnumbered twenty - to - two , and dropped their weapons without a fight . Trent wiped the sweat from his brow , breathing heavily . He turned to his men , nodding toward the prisoners . “"
ARREST THAT BOY: "” he roared , his face contorted with rage . “" "” The room was silent . Then all at once , Trent ’s men surged forward . Then the captain stood , drawing his sword . “" "”"
The High Execution: "“ CAPTAIN , DEFY ME AGAIN ! ”"
Men: "” Sibier met Werrin ’s eyes , seeing the well of compassion there . Real , unyielding compassion . It was n’t the hardened resolve of a soldier or the calculated look of a man weighing strategy . It was raw . It was human . Sibier felt tears come to his face , a hot sensation coming over him . It did n’t make sense . Stars above , Sibier thought from the bottom of his heart , bless this man ! The High Executioner ’s terse voice made Sibier flinch , wrenching the feeling of warmth with his bitter cold . “"
that boy: "” The High Executioner ’s men stepped forwards . Werrin took a wary step back . Then , the men ripped their swords from their scabbards . Panic filled Sibier ’s chest . A hand grabbed Sibier from behind , and he screamed . He spun around , heart hammering , ready to fight . But instead of an attacker , he found one of Werrin ’s men standing behind him — a reassuring presence . The man ’s voice was low but firm , brimming with quiet courage . “"
Captain: "” he snarled , his voice low and dangerous . “" "” Trent warned , his voice cold and heavy with regret . “" "” Werrin did n’t listen . With his uninjured arm , he reached for a dagger strapped to his side and lunged at the High Executioner in a final act of defiance . Sibier ’s heart lurched as Trent stepped aside , catching Werrin ’s wrist with precision . In a fluid motion , Trent twisted the captain ’s arm , forcing him to drop the dagger . The blade clattered to the ground . Trent shoved Werrin backward , and the captain stumbled , his foot catching on his own fallen blade . His head cracked against the stone behind him.[br ] The cavern fell silent , save for the sound of rain and Sibier ’s ragged breathing . The captain did n’t move . Sibier ’s scream tore through the cavern . He stumbled back into the storm , his legs weak , his vision swimming . His gaze darted between Werrin ’s lifeless body and the High Executioner , who stood frozen , his sword lowered . “" "” Trent closed his eyes , his hand clenching into a fist . He muttered something under his breath — too quiet for anyone to hear — before stepping away from Werrin ’s body , and turning his haunted eyes back to Sibier . Sibier ’s body moved before his mind could catch up . He bolted into the night , the storm swallowing him whole . The rain lashed against his skin , his tears mixing with the downpour . He ’s everywhere , Sibier thought , his chest heaving with sobs . I ca n’t escape him . I ca n’t escape any of it . He did n’t know where he was running . It felt as though the stars themselves had turned their backs on him , leaving him to stumble blindly through the storm . They had given him a second to stand and fight the High Executioner . But once again , he had run ."
Men like me: "” The High Executioner ’s men bit their lips at the remark , uncomfortable . A few glanced towards Werrin , uncertain who they should follow . “" "” Werrin shot back , his voice dripping with indignation . He pointed towards all of the soldiers in the room , nearly shouting . “"
The Rebellion Leader: "“ Are you still trying to feed your family , Captain ? ”" "“ To save them from starvation ? “" "” he hissed , but his tone had lost its edge . “" "” The Rebellion Leader ’s voice dropped lower , colder , as he walked unafraid towards Sibier . “"
no one: "“ We ’ll build a kingdom as if it resided in the stars itself . ”"
Its: "“ You try to persuade me to trust you but you ’re not even talented enough to tell you ’ve been followed . ”"
Others: "“ The kingdom tithes stole what we had left to eat days ago ! ”" "“ Please , my children are starving ! ”" "“ Give me more ! ’ Sibier ’s pulse quickened . The crowd swelled around him , arms grabbing and pulling . A hand clamped around his wrist , trying to yank the bag away . “" "” Sibier shouted , his voice hoarse . He tugged the bag back , and the frenzy stilled slightly . Breathing heavily , he raised his free hand . “"
a burly man with wild eyes: "“ Our fields are nutrient deprived . We ca n’t grow our food anymore ! ”"
we: "” a voice demanded from the back . Sibier ’s throat tightened , but he looked to the stars , and took a deep breath . Then , he rolled down his cursed sleeve , revealing his cursed arm . Violet veins pulsed faintly against his skin . The sight was both mesmerizing and unnerving . “" "” [ bookmark ] _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ Chapter Something or Another 2.0 “" "pottage”[cp ]"
The Survivor: "” A shocked silence fell over the crowd , their disbelief palpable . Whispers spread like wildfire . Some stared at him as though he were a divine answer , while others recoiled . Then a woman from the crowd stepped forward , her legs wobbling as she approached . She dropped to her knees , her gaze heavenward . “"
this man with the High Executioner: "” the voice continued . Sibier was able to pick him out : a tall , broad figure with lips too fat for his face and eyes so sunken they looked like empty coin pouches . “"
The Lady: "“ How ? ”" "“ A safehaven of sorts . A place where we can be free from the Kingdom , and a place where we will have food . ”" "“ Son , you expect me to believe that ? You ’re dumber than a pile of rocks . ”" "“ Who are you ? His pet ? ”" "“ What are you trying to use me for , boy ? ”" "“ You ’re ridiculous . ”" "“ To the depths with you ! ”" "“ Let me have my peace already ! ”"
Moma: "” Soaked with tears , Trent felt the familiar scabbard beneath his fingers . Miserably , he withdrew the knife , shaking with fervor . It would be quick . His death would be painless , trivial to the consuming abyss that devoured from the inside . The world would be a better place without him . He saw his dark hair in the reflection , his sharp features staring back at himself with a hollow gaze . If he died here , who would miss him ? Surely the kingdom would cheer with his death and be a happier place without him casting about his darkness . He would be free : free from it all . No more pain ; no more death . Only silence — joyous , calm , unheard silence . He watched his nose crinkled as he cried , just like his mother ’s would have . His face was unearthly pale , ashen grey . He only imagined Selean ’s would be the same as her sickness brought her close to death . Trent ’s sickness , however , would prevail . His sickness would take his life . He lifted the knife , looking away . Trent could n’t watch — he did n’t deserve to die honorably . For the last time , he glanced up through the shattered roof at the stars : so distant , so far away . Had they ever been here for him ? Had the skies really ever returned his praise , ever helped him for all the times he thanked them for ? He felt so sunken in his dread , that it seemed impossible . He was too far for even divinity to help him . Was there anyone he was n’t dead to already ? The kingdom already thought that . He would only be doing them a favor . A young girl stepped through the doorway , meeting Trent ’s eyes briefly before having them dart at her feet . Dirt rusted her face , as she held her hands together , tentatively but hopeful . “" "” She glanced up , looking at Trent quickly , and giving a sly smile . She held her hands behind her back , as she nervously shifted from foot to foot . Trent ’s heart broke . Here he was , High Executioner , traitor and murderer , and here stood a little girl — no older than five — comforting him . He dropped the knife . All his energy seemed sucked away from him , as if drawn into a violent vortex . After all his years of fighting , of rallying men and thousands of inspirational speeches . After all of the accolades , of the pats on the back , and hopeful smiles . After all he had learned , after all of his praise , and all of the advice he had ever heard , it took a girl to say it . To tell him he is stupid . For him to realize he was wrong . For him to realize he needed to forgive himself , and for him to realize he needed to get moving . Guilt is not meant to stay . Sorrow is not meant to be chronic . Fear is not meant to be held . No . They are meant to be temporary , to spur growth to fix what had been broken . He need not drown in them . Heavens above , it was time to swim . Trent stood , turning to the doorway . The girl shyly waddled towards him , giving him a childish hug . “" "” She smiled . Trent smirked , amazed by the innocence . His heart darkened momentarily , as he thought about the stars the girl would later collect . No one could avoid them . Definitely not a little girl as innocent as she . Skies , he used to fight for a better future for people like her . Trent swallowed . I want to do that again . I want to do that again . That little girl did n’t deserve a life counting scars . “" "” The girl said happily , playfully running out of the room . Then she burst back in a few moments later . “"
Rounding: "“ do not blame yourself for this . It is not your fault . ”"
the soldier: "“ A single Darkened Dawn , ”"
Siber: "“ Swine by himself is bringing up the spirits of our community to new highs , ”" "“ and he is good at all the tasks we assign him . I ca n’t believe he just wandered here . ”" "“ You ca n’t have them , ”" "“ Come on kid ! Burn the blasted food ! ”"
Shem: "“ Where is Werrin ? When Karia did n’t speak , Sibier ’s heart pounded faster in his chest . “" "” Karia gave a quick nod . “" "” she whispered , the words coming out only briefly before whisked away by the wind . Nearly haunting with its teasing volume . Selean gasped , covering her mouth , even though she did n’t know Shem or Werrin . Sibier blinked , his arms dropping to his side . He had suspected as much , but he had to know . And now he did . Skies . More men had died for this cause — lives that could never be replaced . At least their sacrifice was being honored . It did not warm his chilled heart . The peace he had felt tonight would not be reclaimed . “"
his dad: "“ Sometimes , Sibier , ”" "“ the skies expect us to place faith in them . Often their silence allows us to learn the most about us . Act . Do . ”"
the Darkened: "“ Finally about time you got to it . We were beginning to wonder if you could n’t figure out a way to cripple them . ”"
Iven: "“ Yes , Sibier is to be left alone . ”" "“ The betrayal will be much more painful to them than his death . It is not necessary . ”" "“ Sibier , ”" "“ I left you alive . It is the only mercy I can give . ”"
The lead member: "“ That equipment belongs to me . ”" "“ Is this klutz Sibier ? ”"
the lead: "“ Break him then , ”" "“ but do n’t kill him . Let 's make this as painful as possible like Roc suggested . ”"
The other two cultists: "“ Shatter the skies — they are with him . ”"
Roc: "“ Really ? ”"
Idiot: "“ Are you here to save us ? ”"
the same voice: "“ This way , ”"
Solemnly: "“ Come on , run ! ”"
The Heti: "“ What ca n’t I have ? ”" "“ My friends . My family . ”" "“ Now get out of my way . ”" "“ When my nation arrives , we will tear you apart for trying to steal our magic . We are your superiors , and you will have to learn your place ! ”" "“ Drown in the depths , you swine . ”" "“ You fools promised us food . Now I will have our retribution for your lies . ”[dd][de"
Lillian: "“ Thank you , ”" "“ Thank you . ”" "“ Thank goodness you 're here , ”" "“ Selean was really worried about you , and she promised to take good care of Ilyian until you returned . Let me tend to your gash . We need to dress those wounds . ”" "“ Come on , ”" "“ Let 's do this . Together . ”"
she: " In her arms , Trent felt the harsh edges of his world soften , the anger and fear that had fueled him dissolving in the warmth of her presence . For the first time in what felt like an eternity , he felt a semblance of peace , a hint of the man he used to be before the weight of his title and the burdens it carried had changed him . Holding Karia close , he allowed himself to breathe , to feel the tension drain from his body , and to momentarily forget the chaos that awaited them beyond the cell . "
