7601	7608	7609	7609	He	31	“ Treat my family with respect ! ”
7686	7697	7698	7699	the King	186	“ Do as he requests ; we are not barbarians , ”
7702	7708	7709	7710	the guard	248	“ Apologies , my King , ”
7721	7729	7718	7718	he	248	“ These scum do n’t deserve respect . ”
7738	7767	7733	7734	the King	186	“ I do not want to hear you speak again today , Guard . You would learn well to appreciate the strength of your enemies . Now go . ”

7821	7825	7826	7826	Trent	31	“ We will , ”
7833	7840	7826	7826	Trent	31	“ Nothing will stand between us . ”
7936	7945	7946	7946	He	31	“ What do you mean you saved her ? ”
7955	7967	7968	7969	the King	186	“ She is alive in prison and her wounds were treated , ”
8025	8079	8016	8016	Icar	32	“ With me , you will never have to worry about the safety and care of Karia or your family . Be assured that your family will be well : they will have the best rooms , the best food , the best security — everything that our kingdom has left to offer . ”
8095	8144	8092	8092	Icar	32	“ Just like you need me , I need you , Trent . I need you to help me save more than just your family . I need you to help me save the people of the Kingdom ! So let us help each other , shall we ? ”
8174	8203	8204	8205	King Icar	32	“ There is nothing you can show me to prove that you are actually interested in saving my people . You wo n’t fool me with your lies . ”
8208	8279	8280	8280	Trent	31	“ You do n’t understand . Rebels never do . You see yourself as so righteous , so virtuous , and so honorable as you claim to fight for a better future . That 's not what others see . I see fraud . I see unfulfilled promises . I see unnecessary fighting , pain , war . Death . And all of it under the false banner of hope . ”
8285	8346	8280	8280	Trent	31	“ If you would only lower your tithes we would n't have to fight . You suppress the people underneath your heel : they can not survive like that ! Do n’t you dare tell me that you do n’t see all the starving children in the streets . They would have money to buy food without your incessant tithes ! ”
8347	8360	8361	8361	Icar	32	“ And we as a kingdom can not survive without those tithes , ”
8367	8422	8361	8361	Icar	32	“ How can you be blind enough not to see the truth ? No one here lives in decadence ! We are under threat by the Heti , and our only option is appraisal by giving them their demanded tribute . That is how we all survive , Trent . Not how you survive . ”
8450	8461	8462	8462	Trent	31	“ Then why do you eat three meals a day ? ”
8465	8476	8462	8462	Trent	31	“ No one else in this kingdom has that privilege . ”
8477	8483	8484	8484	Icar	32	“ The Darkened Dawn does , ”
8494	8512	8513	8513	Trent	31	“ And you are quick to assume , you ingrate . Rarely do I have that privilege . ”
8522	8539	8513	8513	Trent	31	“ You ’re a liar . Why do n’t you just wipe out the Darkened Dawn ? ”
8540	8556	8557	8557	Icar	32	“ They follow their own laws , and they have slipped outside of my grasp , ”
8566	8587	8557	8557	Icar	32	“ That 's precisely why I need you . I need a seasoned war leader like you to defeat them ! ”
8588	8591	8592	8592	Trent	31	“ No , ”
8596	8605	8592	8592	Trent	31	“ No , I wo n’t help you . ”
8659	8667	8650	8650	his	32	“ Why are you so blasted stubborn ? ”
8698	8741	8688	8688	His	31	“ The seas are losing their fish . Our fields are underproducing . And our enemies raise their tribute each year . Soon there will be no food , leaving us with no choice but to risk our lives to harvest seaweed . ”
8742	8749	8750	8750	Trent	31	“ Then forgo your demonic Trials , ”
8753	8766	8750	8750	Trent	31	“ Stop wasting all of our resources to kill our own people ! ”
8799	8802	8803	8803	Trent	31	“ What — ”
8812	8838	8807	8807	Icar	32	“ Those Trials are our future . They are our only way to beat the blasted Heti ! How shortsighted you are not to understand ! ”
8862	8869	8870	8870	he	31	“ Who are these blasted Heti ? ”
8915	8946	8902	8902	His	32	“ Are you serious ? Your single - minded crusade against my throne blinded you to the true state of our world . How can you be so wilfully ignorant ? ”
8965	8968	8969	8969	he	31	“ Enough , ”
8989	8997	8969	8969	he	31	“ Take me back to my family . ”
8998	9018	8972	8972	his	31	“ You help me , and I guarantee their safety . You do n’t make any demands . Understand ? ”
9074	9102	9068	9068	he	31	“ If anything happens to my family , Icar , I will put a sword to your throat . Their safety better be guaranteed , heavens above . ”
9103	9112	9119	9119	his	32	“ Do n’t be a fool , Trent , ”
9122	9145	9113	9114	King Icar	32	“ We can both get what we want : your family can be safe , and I get your help . Easy . ”
9146	9152	9153	9153	Trent	31	“ I saved your life ! ”
9160	9169	9170	9170	Icar	32	“ And I saved your family ’s lives , ”
9174	9182	9170	9170	Icar	32	“ You owe their lives thrice over . ”
9183	9188	9201	9201	Icar	32	“ I hate you . ”
9189	9193	9201	9201	Icar	32	“ I know . ”
9270	9278	9279	9279	he	31	“ What would you have me do ? ”
9284	9298	9299	9299	Icar	32	“ Since you murdered my High Executioner , a position has unexpectedly opened , ”
9308	9315	9299	9299	Icar	32	“ You will take his place . ”
9556	9561	9553	9553	he	31	“ So be it . ”
9728	9735	9736	9736	he	31	" They think I 'm gone , "
9742	9758	9736	9736	he	31	" Maybe it 's better to be a ghost than a monster in their eyes . "
10713	10717	10718	10718	he	31	“ Why me ? ”
10721	10725	10718	10718	he	31	“ Why me ? ”
11157	11162	11163	11163	Trent	31	“ I ’m sorry , ”
11203	11208	11209	11209	Trent	31	“ I ’m sorry , ”
11215	11223	11209	11209	Trent	31	“ but you must come with me . ”
11303	11307	11308	11308	he	442	“ ... Trent ? ”
11321	11330	11331	11331	he	442	“ The rebellion scattered after hearing your death ... ”
11338	11353	11331	11331	he	442	“ But with you back we might have a chance ! You ’re alive ! ”
11385	11390	11391	11391	He	31	" That man is ... "
11437	11444	11445	11445	Trent	31	" Come with me , please , "
11452	11463	11445	11445	Trent	31	" Do n't make this harder for either of us . "

14336	14343	14325	14326	the captain	560	“ Do not disrespect me again . ”
14379	14396	14373	14373	he	31	“ Give me your food , Sir Werrin , and I will be happy to leave . ”
14407	14415	14397	14397	Werrin	57	“ You get my scraps , urchin . ”
14484	14493	14494	14494	he	31	“ That mess back on Earl ’s Road , ”
14501	14539	14494	14494	he	31	“ You would n’t want reports trickling in that you were in charge , do you ? That you were the one who let the riot unfold , the one who failed to strike down three derelicts ? ”
14558	14567	14553	14553	Sibier	31	“ You better leave me alone , urchin . ”
14581	14596	14570	14570	his	31	“ You kill me here and you ’ll look even more like the culprit , ”
14606	14641	14597	14597	Sibier	31	“ I have friends watching right now who ’d be happy to testify they saw you on Earl ’s Road . I do n’t think any of them would mind being promoted to captain … ”
14647	14652	14642	14642	Werrin	57	“ You ’re bluffing . ”
14665	14671	14672	14672	he	31	“ Then call my bluff , ”
14675	14690	14672	14672	he	31	“ or just give me your food , and I ’ll be on my way ”
14809	14818	14819	14819	he	57	“ I could use more men like you , ”
14833	14843	14822	14822	He	57	“ But your threat is a lie , kid . ”
14879	14882	14883	14883	He	57	“ Here . ”
14891	14921	14883	14883	He	57	“ Be back here tomorrow at first light , and I ’ll bring your enlistment papers to sign . You wo n’t have to worry about starving any more . ”
14935	14943	14927	14927	He	31	“ What was your name , kid ? ”
14944	14947	14883	14883	He	57	“ Sibier . ”
14948	14953	14954	14954	Sibier	31	“ And your last ? ”
14993	15000	15001	15001	he	31	“ It 's Sogni , captain , ”
15025	15042	15013	15013	he	57	“ I had heard that the High Executioner had finally visited the last of the Sogni . ”
15143	15149	15135	15135	Werrin	57	“ How did you escape ? ”
15192	15218	15188	15188	Sibier	31	“ I did n’t hear about that . It ’s not my name by birth — I adopted it when David Sogni saved the rebellion . ”
15226	15231	15232	15232	he	57	“ I was there , ”
15237	15270	15232	15232	he	57	“ David lost his closest friend that day . In his sorrow , he became a tempest of rage , and he had that same look in his eyes that you do . ”
15275	15287	15271	15272	The captain	560	“ David never fought again after that . It broke him . ”
15337	15345	15333	15333	he	57	“ Welcome to the team , Sibier . ”
15361	15368	15369	15369	He	31	“ I ’ll see you tomorrow . ”
15467	15473	15474	15476	the burly one	596	“ My name is Yorin , ”
15498	15501	15502	15503	the other	597	“ Terit , ”
15508	15514	15502	15503	the other	597	“ My name is Terit . ”
15553	15560	15561	15561	he	31	“ My name is Sibier Sogni , ”
15564	15590	15561	15561	he	31	“ And I believe we can create something where none of us will go hungry again.¨ Yorin and Terit exchanged glances , their brows raised . “
15600	15618	15619	15619	Terit	51	” Yorin whispered reverently , only for Terit to interrupt . ¨You can get us more food ? ”
15637	15640	15641	15641	he	31	“ Maybe , ”
15651	15670	15641	15641	he	31	“ I have a dream for this kingdom . Do you want to be a part of it ? ”
15684	15692	15693	15693	Yorin	54	“ The one blessed by the stars … ”
15702	15707	15696	15696	his	54	“ Who are you ? ”
15713	15727	15710	15710	his	51	“ Yorin spent too much time in jail reading from those dilapidated words , ”
15729	15732	15733	15733	Yorin	54	“ scriptures , ”
15741	15752	15753	15753	he	51	“ anyways , he ’s a little gone up here , ”
15760	15782	15753	15753	he	51	“ To the depths with it all though , because we ’re in … but what 's the plan , kid ? ”
16060	16064	16065	16067	The High Executioner	384	" Please stop ! "
16082	16085	16086	16086	Sibier	31	“ Please ! ”
16854	16859	16860	16860	he	54	“ Who ’s there ? ”
16898	16906	16907	16907	he	31	“ Easy , it 's just me , ”
16918	16936	16910	16910	Yorin	54	“ What ’s going on then ? You rarely wake a man unless there ’s trouble or ... ”
16951	16957	16958	16958	Sibier	31	" I need a favor , "
16967	16985	16958	16958	Sibier	31	" Could you keep an eye on Ilyian for a bit ? I have to go somewhere . "
16996	17005	16958	16958	Sibier	31	" Where to in the dead of night ? "
17130	17144	17119	17119	his	54	“ You ’re not mixed up with the Darkened Dawn , are you ? ”
17223	17234	17235	17235	he	0	“ No , Yorin , I 'm not with them , ”
17256	17274	17275	17275	Yorin	54	“ I 'm just trying to do what 's best for us , for all of us . ”
17321	17331	17332	17332	Sibier	31	“ I ’m just going to get more food , ”
17498	17505	17485	17485	Sibier	31	“ Yes , I ’ll watch Ilyian ”
17586	17593	17594	17594	he	31	“ I ’ll be back soon , ”
18352	18356	18357	18357	He	31	“ Recruits wanted . ”
18390	18396	18397	18397	he	31	“ Good morning , Captain , ”
18474	18478	18479	18479	he	56	“ You came , ”
18490	18498	18479	18479	he	56	“ I had hoped you would n’t . ”
18612	18614	18615	18615	he	31	“ Wh- ”
18618	18623	18615	18615	he	31	“ What is going — ”
18624	18629	18630	18630	Werrin	56	“ Not a word , ”
18650	18655	18636	18636	He	31	“ Put these on . ”
18852	18859	18860	18860	Werrin	56	“ I ’m sorry , kid , ”
19181	19184	19185	19185	Trent	31	“ Karia , ”
19273	19278	19269	19269	she	36	“ You 're alive ! ”
19513	19523	19500	19500	her	36	“ Trent , what have they done to you ? ”
19612	19615	19616	19616	he	31	“ Karia , ”
19619	19626	19616	19616	he	31	“ I ’ve become something terrible . ”
19664	19667	19668	19668	she	36	“ Why , ”
19681	19688	19668	19668	she	36	“ Why did you do it ? ”
19707	19712	19713	19713	he	31	“ I had to , ”
19716	19727	19713	19713	he	31	“ There was no other way to save my family . ”
19728	19736	19737	19737	she	36	“ Am I not family to you ? ”
19852	19857	19858	19858	he	31	“ I ’m sorry , ”
19873	19879	19858	19858	he	31	“ I had trusted you , ”
19892	19906	19907	19907	Her	36	“ I always had . I ’m not sure if I should anymore . ”
19945	19954	19955	19955	he	31	“ Then , let me make it right , ”
19964	19969	19955	19955	he	31	“ How can you ! ”
20010	20014	20015	20015	she	36	“ Go away , ”
20018	20025	20015	20015	she	36	“ Please , leave me alone . ”
20026	20033	20034	20034	Trent	31	“ You do n’t mean that , ”
20037	20041	20034	20034	Trent	31	“ Do you ? ”
20066	20069	20059	20059	she	36	“ No . ”
20087	20096	20097	20097	he	31	“ I ’ll get you out of here , ”
20100	20106	20097	20097	he	31	“ I ’ll fix this . ”
20123	20130	20131	20131	Trent	31	“ I ’ll get you out , ”
20137	20141	20131	20131	Trent	31	“ I promise ! ”
20162	20167	20168	20168	she	36	“ You 're different , ”
20183	20193	20176	20176	she	36	“ I love you Trent , but please go . ”
20444	20450	20451	20451	he	31	" I love you too , "
20536	20541	20545	20546	King Icar	32	“ Have a seat . ”
20832	20840	20841	20841	he	32	“ You let the boy go free , ”
20864	20868	20869	20869	Icar	32	“ So what ? ”
20886	20911	20869	20869	Icar	32	“ You are the High Executioner . It 's either those on your list who run the trials or your family . Your choice . ”
20920	20939	20940	20940	he	32	“ I was n't going to let you kill the boy . It would have made no difference , ”
20943	20951	20940	20940	he	32	" Why are you so blasted stubborn ! "
20966	20980	20952	20953	King Icar	32	" Ca n't you see anything beyond your own blinding self - righteousness ? "
20981	21045	20952	20953	King Icar	32	” Trent 's hands balled into fists beneath the table , the knuckles whitening . He imagined what it might feel like to punch that crow - like nose … blasted idiot ! Icar leaned forward , his hands pressing flat against the table 's surface , looking like a leopard about to pounce . He lowered his voice to a venomous whisper . “
21076	21098	20952	20953	King Icar	32	” Trent narrowed his eyes , trying to guess King Icar ’s game . Why was the buffoon telling me this ? “
21103	21108	20952	20953	King Icar	32	” the king hissed , “
21115	21142	21143	21143	You	0	” Those words were carefully chosen , designed to pick Trent apart nerve by nerve . And to the depths with it , because it worked . “
21151	21168	21143	21143	You	0	” Trent rose abruptly , pounding the table , sending a reverberating echo through the room . “
21181	21182	21169	21169	I	0	” “
21185	21196	21169	21169	I	0	” Icar chuckled , giving his thin , sly smile . “
21221	21231	21232	21232	Your	0	” He paused , nearly spitting the next words . “
21240	21281	21232	21232	Your	0	” Trent 's hand instinctively drifted to the familiar weight of his sword . In the quiet of the room , it was just him and Icar ... another chance , perhaps , to do what Karia had longed for . “
21293	21294	21282	21287	Captain Werrin of the 7th district	744	” “
21301	21349	21295	21295	I	0	” Trent yelled , cutting him off sharply . Icar raised his eyebrow , inspecting him . Trent felt heat rise within him , his fingers curling around the blade . He took a deep breath . When Icar spoke next it was as cold as steel . “
21358	21468	21350	21350	I	0	” Trent 's restraint shattered . With a visceral roar , he drew his blade , its metallic ring slicing through the tension - filled air . He lunged forward , every muscle taut with fury . Icar , with an unnerving calmness , sidestepped Trent 's initial assault . His expression was eerily composed , as if he had anticipated this very moment . To the depths with him ! He swung , his sword cutting through the air , but Icar was ready . The king parried with his own blade , a still , knowing look in his eyes , a sinister tranquility amidst the chaos . "
21477	21927	21469	21469	You	0	" Icar warned , his voice steady as if untouched by the storm of violence . Trent ’s response was a guttural scream , his body and soul hurling forward in a relentless assault . Icar retreated with fluid grace , countering with swift , precise strikes . All at once , Trent ’s anger and frustration and hate flooded out of him . His blade was a tempest of steel . In his mind , he saw those orphans clinging to his coat , begging for scraps . He hit harder , and Icar stumbled . He saw himself killing Sibier ’s family . He hit harder , and the King fell to his knees . He saw the betrayal and hurt behind Karia ’s eyes … blast it all ! Trent lifted the blade high above his head , and brought it down with everything he had . And then Icar caught the blade . Trent 's eyes widened in horror . He struggled desperately with the hilt , disbelief coursing through him . How ? Icar 's eyes glowed an unnatural purple , his face contorted with concentration . A chill crept down Trent ’s spine , as he stepped back , wide eyed . Icar ’s gloved hand began to emit a strange , hissing sound , and a sinister purple light enveloped it . Trent ’s sword started to disintegrate right before his eyes , the metal corroding as if consumed by an unseen force . The blade crumpled , the tip falling away like dust in the wind . With the grace of a lynx , Icar deftly pushed aside Trent ’s useless sword , seizing the moment of shock . His hand , wrapped in an aura of sinister purple light , clamped around Trent 's throat , lifting him off the ground . Trent gasped , squirming for breath . His eyes widened , as he gaped down at Icar in panic . The King ’s hand hummed , the purple light only getting brighter . Then , with a sickening squelch , Trent felt as though his soul was being torn out of him . The pain was unbearable . Frantically , Trent kicked and thrashed , but it was futile against Icar 's unnatural strength . His lungs screamed for oxygen , and his soul felt as if it were being peeled away , layer by agonizing layer . Desperately , he wanted to cry out , to beg for mercy , but he could not find his voice . In a silent plea , Trent ’s eyes locked with Icar ’s , a wordless entreaty for his life . "
21930	21979	21469	21469	You	0	" he tried to mouth , his vision blurring into darkness . The pain was too much . Heavens above , it was too much ! Icar gave his thin smile . He turned his head , his crow - like eyes observed Trent with an unsettling detachment . "
21982	22111	21469	21469	You	0	" Trent mouthed again , his consciousness teetering on the edge . He clenched his eyes shut , his mind screaming for an end to the torment . He was praying for a miracle . Praying for release . Just make it stop ! Abruptly , Icar released him . Trent collapsed to the floor , each breath a ragged , precious gulp of air . His throat felt scorched by the dark power that had invaded him , leaving a trail of searing agony . Coughing and gasping , Trent 's vision swam chaotically . Inside , he felt his very soul quiver , recoiling from the unspeakable violation it had endured . Finally , Trent choked out the words , each one falling between different breaths . “
22114	22118	22120	22120	you	748	” he gasped , “
22124	22270	22120	22120	you	748	” King Icar , with an air of nonchalance , settled into his chair and slowly removed his gloves . For the first time , Trent saw the king ’s hands laid bare . One was normal , but the other – the one that had gripped him – was a sight of horror . It pulsed with purple veins , its skin etched with deep , canyon - like crevices , a grotesque map of power and corruption . Trent swallowed hard , a primal fear gripping him as he beheld the true extent of Icar 's cursed existence . Icar was more than just a tyrant … he was … he was … he was … Trent shook his head . He did n’t know what Icar was . Heavens above . What had just happened ? Icar spoke , his authority unquestioned . “
22284	22292	22120	22120	you	748	” His words hung in the air . “
22311	22318	22319	22319	Tr[m]ent	61	“ We could beat the Heti . ”
22329	22341	22322	22322	his	61	“ You got that … that curse from surviving the Trials ? ”
22360	22377	22378	22379	The king	186	“ No , I did n’t go through the Trials ; I survived something much worse . ”
22394	22417	22384	22384	his	186	“ The Heti attacked my people when I was a kid . I was the only one who escaped to this kingdom . ”
22520	22534	22511	22512	The tyrant	213	“ Ca n't you see anything beyond your own blinding self - righteousness ? ”
22541	22548	22549	22549	Trent	31	“ What happened to those people ? ”
22552	22567	22549	22549	Trent	31	“ They were slaughtered like livestock , and their attack did this to me . ”
22606	22623	22624	22624	Trent	31	“ If [ n]you're not from here , then you 're not King Visio ’s son , ”
22634	22637	22638	22638	he	32	“ Obviously , ”
22651	22695	22638	22638	he	32	“ The King found me nearly dead where the Island touches the ocean . They saw my powers as a gift from the stars , and knew that I would be the answer to free this kingdom from the grasp of the Heti . ”
22735	22741	22742	22742	Icar	32	“ So they adopted you ? ”
22803	22837	22846	22847	King Icar	32	“ They gave their actual son to King Visio ’s sister . I took his place , and everyone that knew had to keep the secret . Visio studied me , and began conducting “
22839	22845	22846	22847	King Icar	32	” to replicate my power . ”
22866	22883	22884	22884	Trent	31	“ Those trials soon became dangerous , and they could no longer test them on me . ”
22978	22989	22972	22972	he	31	“ It 's time you accompany me to the Trials . ”
23294	23314	23315	23315	Sibier	31	“ I brought you these , as I noticed you did n’t eat the ones I gave you earlier . ”
23411	23419	23420	23420	he	31	“ What do you want from me ? ”
23443	23455	23456	23456	he	31	“ Sibier Sogni , the blasted king himself ordered your arrest , ”
23467	23476	23456	23456	he	31	“ They are requiring you for the Trials . ”
23552	23566	23567	23567	he	31	" I can not face the Trials . I must find my brother , "
23616	23619	23620	23620	he	31	“ Please , ”
23623	23628	23620	23620	he	31	“ let me go . ”
23656	23672	23673	23673	Ilyian	46	" he implored , eyes locked on Werrin , searching for any sign of mercy . "
23682	23717	23673	23673	Ilyian	46	" Biting his lip , Sibier leaned forward , searching Werrin for any sign of hope . Yet , something weighed the captain down : his eyes sagged , and his movements were slow . “
23725	23730	23673	23673	Ilyian	46	” he spoke softly . “
23746	23769	23675	23675	he	46	” Sibier nodded : he knew this already , but it did n’t matter . He could n’t go to the trials . “
23772	23783	23675	23675	he	46	” Werrin sighed , placing his fist on the table . “
23808	23869	23795	23796	The King	186	” Like that , Sibier realized , it 's over . He felt his blood run cold . Silently , he wrestled with the cuffs around his legs , glancing at the door behind the captain . He might have better luck in the storm … [o ] Werrin looked to the ceiling , thinking . Cautiously , he spoke . “
23883	23889	23890	23890	I	0	” Sibier froze . What ? “
23924	23925	23921	23922	a spy	787	” “
23932	23977	23921	23922	a spy	787	” Sibier blurted . It would n’t give him the rank he needed , but he would survive . He could find another way to accomplish his dream , but heavens above , he needed to live . And this seemed like his chance . "
23987	23993	23979	23979	I	0	" Werrin ’s expression hardened . "
24029	24037	24016	24016	Your	31	" Sibier recoiled , his plea impassioned . “
24045	24054	24040	24040	He	4044	” Werrin , unmoved , faced Sibier squarely . “
24076	24077	24073	24073	you	31	” “
24083	24216	24078	24078	You	31	” Siber snapped . His tone shocked himself , uncharacteristically like him , but at the moment he did n’t care . He was hungry , scared , stressed and worried . Skies , he could almost feel his parents watching him from the stars . They had taught him that the family was always supposed to stick together — no matter what . If he abandoned Ilyian , he would give up a part of who he was . He would give up their dream . He would give up the Sogni legacy . He took a deep breath and closed his eyes , a prayer in his mind . Heavens above , help . I ca n’t let that happen . Pulling off his gloves , Werrin folded his arms . “
24226	24230	24221	24221	I	0	” he challenged . “
24251	24257	24258	24258	I	0	” Sibier did n’t relent . “
24263	24286	24258	24258	I	0	” He rustled with his shackles . Werrin sighed , the finality in his voice a cold hand around Sibier 's heart . "
24305	24402	24403	24403	I	0	" Sibier 's gaze drifted to the door , the symbol of an escape he knew was unattainable . The cold metal of the shackles bit into his wrists as he pondered the gravity of Werrin 's proposition . Embracing the role of a spy meant abandoning any hope of reuniting with Ilyian , relinquishing their shared dreams , and betraying the legacy his parents died defending . But he would survive . Could he live with himself after paying such a cost ? His throat tightened , the decision looming over him like a shadow . "
24407	24434	24435	24435	I	0	" His voice trailed off , uncertainty clouding his judgment . He felt a tear roll down from his eyes . I never told Ilyian goodbye . “
24440	24459	24435	24435	I	0	” he whispered . He felt as though those three words split his heart . Werrin leaned closer . “
24464	24550	24551	24551	We	796	” Suddenly , the door crashed open , unleashing a blast of cold air that cut through the chamber . The High Executioner loomed in the threshold . Sibier 's heart seized , every instinct screaming for him to flee , yet the chains mocked his desperation . Run , he thought . But his feet kicked against each other uselessly . His heart began to pound in his chest . Run . Werrin snapped to attention , his fatigue instantly replaced by rigid formality . "
24558	24759	24551	24551	We	796	" he said , masking his surprise with respect . The High Executioner only grunted , keeping the hood drawn over his face . He brushed past Werrin , fixing Sibier with a gaze that felt as if it pierced through to his soul . The High Executioner appeared almost as a ghoul as he neared , and Sibier 's mind reeled with haunting memories of his parents ' final moments . Their screams echoed in his ears , their loss igniting a primal fear within him . Skies ! He could hear his father ’s scream . He could see his mother drool blood . His fingers clawed at his skin as he watched his father get kicked again and again . He had felt so helpless then … Run . Grimacing , he squirmed against his restraints , a futile attempt to distance himself from the approaching figure . With heavy footfalls , the High Executioner advanced , and Sibier could smell his breath . It smelt like his father ’s blood . Sibier snapped . Panic overtook him , and in a moment of desperation , he toppled from his chair , his body convulsing in terror . "
24764	24971	24551	24551	We	796	" His voice was a raw , fractured plea , his limbs flailing wildly in a frantic bid for freedom . Sibier 's mind was a tumultuous sea of terror , each nightmare crashing into him with the force of a tempest . He envisioned his mother , bound and helpless , her cries of anguish merging with the sinister laughter of the Darkened Dawn . And there , orchestrating the torment , was Trent , his presence a shadowy specter haunting Sibier 's every thought . Desperation clawed at his heart . There has to be a way out ! Run . Yet , he was trapped . Escape seemed as distant as the stars . The cold , unyielding pressure of the High Executioner 's boot against his back anchored him to the harsh reality of the stone floor . Air struggled to find its way to his lungs as panic set his body to tremble , his cries for freedom echoing off the uncaring walls . Heavens above , help me ! But his chains remained tight , and the High Executioner only pressed harder . In a frenzy , Sibier clashed his shackles against the stone , his eyes wild with fear . "
24976	25012	25014	25014	he	0	" he screamed , the plea a raw burst of his dwindling hope . The High Executioner regarded him with a chilling detachment , then turned to Werrin with a command cold as the grave . "
25029	25042	25024	25024	You	0	" Werrin 's response was a terse nod , his expression unreadable . “

28784	28788	28789	28789	Sibier	31	“ Sounds familiar , ”
28792	28798	28789	28789	Sibier	31	“ Have we met before ? ”
28827	28842	28843	28843	Sibier	31	“ If it 's alright with you , I ’ll be on my way , ”
28846	28852	28843	28843	Sibier	31	“ May we meet again . ”
29163	29166	29167	29167	Sibier	31	“ Dad ! ”
29787	29796	29778	29778	he	31	“ Father and mother , I ’m sorry . ”
29899	29909	29910	29910	he	32	“ After all the times I ’ve done this , ”
29913	29920	29910	29910	he	32	“ I still hate it[t ] . ”
30009	30032	30033	30033	he	32	“ The kid will likely live far into the trial . He has a fiery determination , and an almost unquenchable hope , ”
30038	30045	30033	30033	he	32	“ He reminds me of you . ”
30143	30158	30140	30140	Icar	32	“ Yes , he will go far , but I doubt he will live . ”
30250	30265	30235	30235	Icar	32	“ With this Trial , you 'll fully assume the mantle of High Executioner . ”
30309	30330	30306	30306	Icar	32	“ Let ’s pray you ’ll finally figure the secret out of trials , and bless our people with power . ”
30491	30496	30497	30497	he	31	" Stop the trial , "
30517	30527	30497	30497	he	31	" Halting now jeopardizes everything we 've worked for . "
30542	30561	30497	30497	he	31	“ Stop the trial , '' he demanded . Icar ’s voice was even , always in control . “
30578	30692	30573	30573	His	31	” In frustration , Trent hit his side , squinting in pain . Blast that man ! He cursed mentally . He does n’t deserve a seat among the stars . And what about you ? a little piece of him asked . His blood went cold , and a deepening crevice widened inside of him . Sibier winced , and the kid ’s pain reverberated down into the echoes of his soul . Am I any better ? As if in response to his hurt , the mist coalesced into a dark form , mocking Trent ’s silent pleas for Sibier ’s deliverance . Icar ’s detached explanation only made it worse . "
30714	30730	30573	30573	His	31	" Trent felt sick . He itched to do something , yet he felt immobilized . “
30733	30737	30573	30573	His	31	” he started , “
30751	30776	30740	30740	we	884	” Icar kept silent , staring emptily ahead . The king ’s quiet pressed against Trent ’s nerves , his anger threatening to explode . “
30783	30787	30789	30789	me	0	” he cursed . “
30792	30812	30813	30813	We	884	” Icar was not fazed by Trent ’s outburst , but spoke softly , as if burdened by memories . “
30827	30850	30851	30851	I	0	” he paused , then shuddered . He jabbed two of his fingers forward , his other hand grasping his cursed arm . “
30880	30900	30859	30859	Heti	40	” his voice was remorseful , and even filled with pain , as though he was reliving the moment . “
30905	30958	30859	30859	Heti	40	” Trent felt no pity for the King . How could he as he watched Sibier endure the very pains worse than the very depths of themselves ? Sibier backed away from the mist as it swirled and stung him , its form becoming a warrior . Skies , he needed something ! “
30975	30976	30977	30977	We	886	” “
30981	30987	30977	30977	We	886	” King Icar answered shortly . “
30995	31008	30988	30988	They	887	” Exasperated , Trent threw his hands in the air , roaring . “
31015	31043	31013	31013	you	888	” King Icar leaned in , his hand cutting through the air to demand silence , his eyes alight with a sudden mixture of curiosity and awe . “
31049	31416	31045	31045	you	888	” he whispered , a tone that beckoned Trent 's full attention . Trent , still simmering with anger and disbelief , could n't help but be drawn to the spectacle . Sibier , illuminated by a mysterious purple glow reminiscent of Icar 's own aura , wielded a pipe with unexpected prowess . The boy was a whirlwind of desperation and determination , battling the mist that seemed almost sentient in its attack . Trent 's heart caught in his throat . The resemblance to Icar ’s mystical abilities was uncanny . Could it be ? Did the Trials work ? Had they finally created magic ? Trent almost refused to believe it . Even though doubt clawed at Trent , he found himself unable to tear his eyes away from Sibier ’s valiant struggle . Each movement , each swing , each strike was a testament to a burgeoning power Trent had never witnessed . With a move of pure desperation , Sibier plunged the pipe through the figure , dissolving it into a cloud of mist . Trent stepped closer , a prayer on his lips . You got this , Sibier . Just … survive . But doubt shadowed his hope . How did anyone even survive the Trials ? How could Sibier possibly find his way out of this nightmare ? The very concept of survival within the Trials seemed a cruel joke , an impossible feat designed to torment both subject and observer . As the mist coalesced once more , it formed figures all too familiar and Trent felt a cold dread grip him . He instantly recognized Sibiers parents . The apparitions were locked in their final moments just as they had been in reality , Sibier ’s mother hunched over her father . The sight of her tears dripping from her cheeks onto her husband was like a crushing hand over his soul.[u ] In anguish , Trent hit his side again , squinting through the jolts of pain . It was easier than dealing with the emotional echo of horror before him . Icar , ever the observer , murmured to himself , lost in thought . "
31419	31428	31045	31045	you	888	" he said quietly , almost to himself . "
31441	31465	31466	31467	This boy	474	" His gaze , fixed on Sibier ’s tormented figure , was tinged with a mix of fascination and something akin to respect . "
31478	33492	31466	31467	This boy	474	" Heavens above , Trent cursed . Is this what Sibier feared the most ? Reliving the destruction that I had brought to his family ? Trent felt the grip of a cold specter tighten around his heart , and his guilt pooled inside of him like miasma . ibier 's desperate cry pierced the heavy air as he surged toward the apparitions of his family . But the scene morphed into a grotesque parody of his hopes ; his father faded into nothingness while his mother 's form twisted into the visage of the High Executioner . Sibier recoiled , his shock a mirror to Trent 's own heart - stopping realization . Could it be ? Am I what he fears most ? Trent felt as though he swallowed a sword . The mist was painfully accurate . He felt an eerie dissonance as if he were both spectator and participant , watching himself advance with a drawn blade against Sibier . The High Executioner 's relentless assault , a grim reflection of his own potential for destruction sickened him . Skies . He sickened him . It was getting hard to breathe , as Trent felt like the very air around him constricted in dismay . I need to do something . A fierce resolve ignited within him . It was clear Sibier stood no chance against the High Executioner . Without intervention , Sibier would meet his end here . Trent 's hand instinctively reached for his sword , the metal cold and grounding against his palm . The High Executioner advanced , striking Sibier with a brutal force that sent him sprawling to the ground . Trent nearly choked , a lump forming in his throat . It was time to act . For Sibier , for redemption , for all that still could be righted in this world gone awry . Heavens above . If Sibier were to die here , it might as well have been his own family . Growling , Trent drew his blade in a flash , slamming its pommel against the glass in a fluid motion . A web of fractures bloomed across the surface , and the panels shook against the pure force of his blow . But blast it ! That was n’t enough . His heart hammered against his ribs , each beat a ticking clock echoing Sibier 's dwindling chances . He attacked the glass again , his efforts more frantic . Time was slipping through his fingers like grains of sand , each moment pushing Sibier closer to the brink of death . The glass protested under the assault , cracking further under the relentless pommel , yet obstinately refusing to yield . Through the burgeoning network of fractures , Trent caught sight of his spectral double poised to deliver a fatal strike . It was a motion Trent knew all too well , a dance of death he had orchestrated more times than he cared to remember . This realization only fueled his desperation , his blows against the glass growing in intensity . The barrier , however , mocked him with its resilience , deepening his despair . Tears of frustration and fear welled in his eyes , spilling over as he unleashed a litany of curses . He was so close , yet impossibly far . Driven by a primal roar , Trent gathered every ounce of his strength , his entire being focused on the next strike . The pommel hit the glass with a thunderous impact ... only to be repelled . In that heart - stopping moment , as the High Executioner 's sword descended upon Sibier , time itself seemed to pause . Sibier , with a prayer on his lips , weakly raised his arms . And caught the blade.[v][w ] Trent felt his eyes widen , his mouth opening in awe . Did the stars do that ? He wondered . He stood transfixed as Sibier , with a defiance that seemed to draw from the very depths of his soul , wrested the blade from the High Executioner 's grasp and cast it aside . This display of resilience , of an indomitable spirit , was a beacon of hope in the darkness . For a moment , Trent once again dared to believe in miracles . Yet , Sibier was far from winning . Without the loss of momentum , the High Executioner ’s punch cracked against Sibier ’s jaw . Adrenaline kicked into Trent ’s veins . Time was running out . Stepping away from the glass , Trent drew a deep , steadying breath , and then abandoned all caution . In a fit of fury , he launched himself at the glass with the full force of his shoulder . The barrier buckled under his assault , a web of fractures spreading from the point of impact , the promise of breach tantalizingly close . Shard of glass cut into his skin , and he welcomed the pain . Flames of fury roared within , each pulse urging him forward . Just one more effort . One more time . Meanwhile , the mist 's assault on Sibier reached a merciless crescendo , its cruel kick shattering the last of the young fighter 's resistance . With triumph , his boots clamped Sibier ’s arm to the ground . And like hundreds of battles before , Trent finally felt everything come in focus . It was clear . His identity , his very essence , was inescapable . I am this kingdom ’s blasted rebellion leader ! With a resolve forged in the fires of countless battles , Trent recoiled like a spring and hurled himself with abandon . The glass shattered , shards glittering like stars in his peripheral vision as he rolled into the fray . Sword in hand , he rose like a phoenix from ashes , his blade an extension of his will . And his blade cut off the High Executioner ’s hand . The ethereal knife and hand dissipated into the air , but the mist lashed out in retaliation . The mist around his feet pricked him , feeling like little claws digging into his skin . Trent , the rebellion hero , barely even noticed . To him , pain was all too familiar . Trent 's heart pounded as he deftly stepped back , evading the High Executioner 's swift counterattack . Droplets of sweat formed a familiar veil on his face , and he welcomed the pressure and split - second decisions . A wistful realization struck him : It has been too long since I ’ve truly fought.[x ] The High Executioner , with a motion that seemed to defy reality , materialized a new sword from the very air . The blade was unmistakable — it was Karia 's , a sight that sent a cold wave of dread washing over Trent . The presence of her weapon here , in this nightmarish duel , twisted a knot of worry within him . How was Karia ? What had become of her ? The High Executioner wasted no time , pressing the attack and snapping Trent back to the grim present . Trent met the assault with a dancer 's grace , each parry and thrust a chorus of his years of training and battles fought . Every slash was precise . Every movement exact . Every swing calculated . This was his game . This was his battle . This was him . The rebellion leader . The hero who had once vanquished the High Executioner . He could do it again . Yet , this encounter bore an uncanny difference ; the High Executioner anticipated Trent 's every strategy , mirroring his tactics as though he was battling his own shadow . And when Trent dared to meet his adversary 's gaze , he was met with a reflection of himself , but twisted by a deep - seated hatred and loathing that he recognized all too well . It was a part of him he had always sought to bury deep within — something that lurked in the very chambers of his heart . An unearthly chill crawled through him : He was n’t fighting the High Executioner but he was confronting the darkest facets of his own soul , a manifestation of the man he feared he had become . Could this be who I am ? A spear of guilt impaled him as Karia 's sword , now wielded by this dark reflection , arced towards him . Warrior ’s only wielder ’s other blades when their owner had fallen … As he raised his sword instinctively to block the incoming strike , tears blurred his vision . The memory of Karia 's embrace , the warmth and safety of their last moment together , pierced through the chaos of the fight . Her defeat and her absence was a weight he bore , a silent accusation of his failure . Heavens above , he could still feel her tender arms wrapping around him , imagining the warmth of their last embrace … As the High Executioner lunged with lethal precision , Trent 's instincts surged to the forefront , pushing him to a frenzied dance of life and death . His attempt at a counter was swiftly rebuffed , the clash sending sparks of frustration igniting within him . Rage began to smolder in the depths of Trent 's soul , each memory of sacrifice for her , for the rebellion , fanning the flames into an inferno . The High Executioner was his enemy . And Trent was going to make him pay . Growling , he upended the High Executioner , his movements becoming a tempest of precision and fury . His assault was relentless , a barrage of strikes delivered with a cold , exacting vengeance . Vengeance for Karia . The trials , the very essence of his torment , became the target of his wrath . A cascade of hatred flowed through Trent ; towards the trials , towards King Icar , towards the entity that dared to mirror his darkest aspects . The loathing was palpable , a bitter taste in his mouth as he swept the High Executioner ’s weapon to the floor , rendering him defenseless . There was no pause , no hesitation in Trent 's resolve as he prepared the final strike . The eyes that met him were a reflection of his own , swirling with hatred and defiance . Yet , with a swift motion , his blade sang through the mist , severing the connection between them as the apparition dissolved into nothingness . For once , Trent wished he could have had the satisfaction of sinking his blade into the man ’s heart . Panting , the sword heavy in his grip , Trent caught sight of King Icar battling his own phantoms . Serves him right , he thought , a dark satisfaction in the king 's struggle . But the soft groan of Sibier drew Trent ’s attention back to him , breaking him from his daze . The kid was broken , his eyes glazed with exhaustion and pain . Blood caked his skin , and scratch marks covered him like he had been ripped apart by starved wolves . He was nearly dead . Even with the apparition defeated , a haunting vision of Karia lingered in his mind , a painful reminder of all he had lost , all he had failed to protect . With a heavy heart , he sheathed his sword and carefully lifted Sibier , the weight of responsibility anchoring him to his purpose . Not looking back , Trent took off running . _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ The Warleader Chapter Eleven

39290	39331	39287	39287	Karia	36	“ Do you know what it feels like to be so close to achieving everything you ever wanted , then have it snatched away from you ? Do you know what it is like to lose what you love most ? ”
39340	39368	39332	39332	Her	36	“ You only live because of Trent ’s heart . He put his own family at risk to save you . He never did that for me . ”
39398	39402	39403	39403	he	31	“ Blast it , ”
39406	39417	39403	39403	he	31	“ Do you know what he did to my family ? ”
39451	39456	39457	39457	Sibier	31	“ He murdered them , ”
39460	39464	39457	39457	Sibier	31	“ Without mercy . ”
39488	39499	39473	39473	she	36	“ Who were your parents ? Tyrants in the kingdom ? ”
39521	39531	39500	39500	Sibier	31	“ My fathers name was David . David Sogni . ”
39540	39543	39544	39544	she	36	“ No , ”
39551	39557	39558	39558	She	36	“ He would n’t have . ”
39621	39629	39614	39614	His	31	“ I ’m sorry . Forgive me . ”
39661	39674	39675	39675	she	36	“ You know he is only trying to save his own family , ”
39678	39689	39675	39675	she	36	“ King Icar is forcing him to do those things . ”
39782	39805	39779	39779	she	36	“ I love him , Sibier , and he betrayed me also to save them . He could n’t let them die . ”
39862	39870	39871	39871	Sibier	31	“ Then you know how I feel , ”
39883	39891	39874	39874	his	31	“ and I know how you feel . ”
39933	39940	39941	39941	he	31	“ And it hurts so bad , ”
39951	39987	39988	39988	He	31	“ It feels as though a part of you was torn away and given to swine . The anguish is so insufferable that it feels like it can never be healed , and never corrected . ”
40005	40017	40018	40018	he	31	“ But there is more to the pain than just hurt , ”
40022	40039	40018	40018	he	31	“ There is growth … but only if you do n’t let it keep you down . ”
40051	40092	40040	40040	Sibier	31	“ Karia , from this we can create a new community , a place where there is no heartache , no starvation . A place where we can be free and save lives . It will be like a dream . ”
40099	40107	40093	40093	Karia	36	“ You want to start another rebellion ? ”
40113	40160	40110	40110	his	31	“ No , the rebellion ’s fire has been extinguished . But we can create a kingdom where no child hungers on the streets , where no one begs for food . A place where no one hides from the shadows , and where trust reigns . ”
40176	40235	40162	40162	he	31	“ You can make this world a better place , Karia . People brighten when they see you — they rally behind who you are . They encourage your every step , and they will defend you with fierce loyalty . Surely they will come , Karia , and we can leave the tyrants of this kingdom behind . ”
40275	40283	40284	40284	Karia	36	“ How could we possibly do that ? ”
40293	40302	40287	40287	her	36	“ The people are broken . We lost . ”
40303	40309	40310	40310	Sibier	31	“ You do n’t understand , ”
40319	40383	40313	40313	his	31	“ We do n’t have to fight anyone . My father had found a trove of food underneath the islands — we can harvest and feed the people . Those on the streets will come to us , and we will have food and work for them . We can build our own kingdom without tearing one down . That is the vision ! ”
40384	40388	40389	40389	Karia	36	“ No fighting ? ”
40403	40411	40395	40395	her	36	“ I ’ll give it a try . ”
40436	40439	40440	40440	Ilyian	46	“ Si ! ”
40519	40528	40540	40540	his	51	“ Thank the heavens ! You 're safe ! ”
40529	40536	40540	40540	his	51	“ At no expense to us , ”
40546	40559	40540	40540	his	51	“ The child practically ate the entire bag of food by himself . ”
40580	40592	40593	40593	he	54	“ Kid , we did n’t think you were coming back , ”
40850	40856	40857	40857	he	31	“ I brought a friend , ”
40895	40901	40887	40887	She	36	“ Her name is Karia . ”
40912	40929	40906	40906	Terit	51	“ I know who she is . Why is she here ? She does n’t belong . ”
40930	40934	40939	40939	his	31	“ Everyone belongs , ”
40943	40963	40939	40939	his	31	“ I promised you a place where no one hungers again , did n’t I ? That means everyone . ”
41007	41019	41020	41020	Terit	51	“ Yeah , I was wondering when you would fulfill that , ”
41024	41035	41036	41036	Sibier	31	“ Well Karia is going to help us with that , ”
41192	41228	41183	41183	her	36	“ Two islands west of here used to be a rebel hideout . It will be an ideal place to establish a new community , and to build out of the ashes of the rebellion . ”
41243	41254	41229	41229	Terit	51	“ I did n’t sign up to join a rebellion . ”
41262	41270	41271	41271	he	31	“ We are n’t starting a rebellion , ”
41275	41301	41271	41271	he	31	“ But we are building a new community . Creating a new district where there will be food and work , separate from the kingdom . ”
41302	41308	41309	41309	Terit	51	“ So , a rebellion , ”
41410	41438	41399	41399	She	36	“ Terit , this is n’t about rebellion . It ’s about survival . It ’s about giving people a chance to live , not just exist . ”
41451	41480	41443	41443	his	51	“ And what makes you think we can do it ? What makes you so sure we wo n’t fail like that old , blasted rebellion of yours ? ”
41519	41549	41500	41500	His	31	“ Because this time , we have a vision and a legacy to follow . There ’s a secret to these islands , Terit , and I know it . ”
41550	41557	41558	41558	Karia	36	“ We will only need equipment , ”
41572	41595	41561	41561	Terit	51	“ Girl , we do n’t have any materials , or tools to make equipment , people , or even blasted food . ”
41601	41607	41596	41596	Karia	36	“ Excuse me ? Girl ? ”
41645	41647	41624	41624	He	31	“ community ”
41667	41670	41671	41671	Sibier	31	“ Terit , ”
41675	41684	41671	41671	Sibier	31	“ we plan on getting all of those . ”
41685	41688	41671	41671	Sibier	31	“ How , ”
41775	41787	41788	41788	Sibier	31	“ We are n’t the only ones who know this secret , ”
41791	41816	41788	41788	Sibier	31	“ From Karia ’s intel , I believe the Darkened Dawn already knows too , and they might already have the equipment we need . “
41830	41862	41817	41817	We	1054	” Karia added bluntly . At that , Yorin ’s eyes widened , but Terit seemed unfazed . To him , it must have been another dream lost among the stars . “
41889	41893	41817	41817	We	1054	” he mumbled , “
41896	41905	41817	41817	We	1054	” Karia frowned , her frustration clearly visible . “
41915	41916	41907	41907	you	31	” “
41919	41931	41907	41907	you	31	” Terit answered , throwing another rock off of the cliff . “
41940	41955	41907	41907	you	31	” Once again , Karia turned to Sibier , her voice a low hiss . “
41967	41985	41964	41965	somebody else	1061	” Sibier felt his heart drop at the question , yet it resonated deep inside of him . “
41999	42021	41997	41997	everybody	1063	” he reminded her , but he began to wonder if it was a mistake recruiting Terit in the first place . “
42029	42033	42034	42034	someone	992	” Karia warned , “
42049	42132	42034	42034	someone	992	” Sibier blinked , unsure of how to respond . Skies , he had never considered the risk of betrayal . It would be easy for someone to turn against them , but why would they ? What threat did they pose ? Yet , despite his rationale , Karia ’s words left a sour taste in his mouth . These days , some people would do anything for simply a meal . Leaning away from Sibier , Karia continued to explain . “
42167	42178	42157	42157	them	1066	” Terit scoffed , his expression a mask of disdain . “
42190	42198	42186	42186	We	1054	” he mocked , shaking his head . “
42251	42252	42245	42245	Yorin	54	” “
42257	42268	42253	42253	They	1068	” Yorin muttered softly , but Karia spoke over him . “
42287	42302	42280	42280	Sibier	31	” Sibier nodded , kissing Ilyian lightly on his forehead before setting him down . “
42312	42312	42303	42303	He	31	”
42822	42827	42828	42828	he	31	“ Are you sure ? ”
42845	42848	42833	42833	She	36	“ Wait . ”
42935	42939	42930	42930	Sibier	31	“ Lets go . ”
42957	42959	42961	42961	she	36	“ Stay ”
43177	43185	43172	43172	his	56	“ Who were you talking to kid ? ”
43196	43210	43186	43186	He	56	“ And if you scream , I ’ll rip your heart right out . ”
43222	43227	43228	43228	he	31	“ I was praying , ”
43392	43402	43403	43403	he	31	“ Did you come back to accept my offer ? ”
43425	43436	43417	43417	his	31	“ No . I came to ask for your help . ”
43454	43477	43478	43478	Werrin	56	“ I offered you my help , did n’t I ? But by the stars above you ended up at the Trials , ”
43489	43501	43483	43483	his	56	“ How did you do it ? How did you escape ? ”
43534	43540	43541	43541	he	31	“ I did n’t escape , ”
43544	43548	43541	43541	he	31	“ I survived . ”
43588	43592	43593	43593	he	31	“ The rumors , ”
43599	43605	43593	43593	he	31	“ Do you have magic ? ”
43614	43622	43606	43606	Sibier	31	“ I need a favor , Captain . ”
43645	43651	43635	43635	his	31	“ What kind of favor ? ”
43667	43686	43659	43659	Sibier	31	“ I need your men to steal equipment from the Darkened Dawn and to bring me with you . ”
43731	43740	43722	43722	he	56	“ What would happen if I said no ? ”
43741	43745	43746	43746	Sibier	31	“ Do n’t , ”
43750	43769	43746	43746	Sibier	31	“ because we need your help to do it . We are going to create a better world . ”
43770	43805	43722	43722	he	56	“ Kid , I do n’t know how you survived those blasted Trials , but I ’m not going to help you start a rebellion . You ’re too idealistic for a realist world . ”
43806	43814	43815	43815	Sibier	31	“ We are n’t starting any rebellion , ”
43819	43846	43815	43815	Sibier	31	“ We are building a place where no one has to starve again . Skies , we are fixing this kingdom instead of tearing it apart . ”
43850	43866	43847	43847	Werrin	56	“ And you are going to do that by waging war on the Darkened Dawn ? ”
43949	43952	43953	43953	he	31	“ Yes , ”
43968	43976	43977	43977	he	56	“ You are out of your mind ! ”
43980	43990	43977	43977	he	56	“ Not even the kingdom can regulate them anymore ! ”
43991	43999	44000	44000	Sibier	31	“ Do n’t you have a family ? ”
44005	44018	44000	44000	Sibier	31	“ Do n’t you want to fix this blasted kingdom for them ? ”
44148	44154	44155	44155	he	56	“ I have two daughters , ”
44165	44185	44155	44155	he	56	“ I give them half my food each day , and still they do n’t get enough to eat . ”
44195	44238	44239	44239	Sibier	31	“ Blast it , kid . I ’ve spent my whole life trying to make enough to feed my family . But with the Darkened Dawn constantly raiding the fishing holes and burning our crops , there simply is n’t enough food . ”
44277	44286	44287	44287	Sibier	31	“ We can get food for your family , ”
44290	44301	44287	44287	Sibier	31	“ But we need that equipment from the Darkened Dawn . ”
44309	44327	44304	44304	his	56	“ Kid , it 's impossible . I ’ve spent my whole career trying to thwart them . ”
44413	44422	44423	44423	Sibier	31	“ I have something the Kingdom does n’t , ”
44426	44454	44423	44423	Sibier	31	“ We could conquer the Darkened Dawn and unearth their secrets . Imagine the legend you would become as the captain to finally bring down their cult . ”
44469	44472	44473	44473	he	31	“ Magic , ”
44478	44483	44473	44473	he	31	“ They did it . ”
44605	44611	44612	44612	Sibier	31	“ This is our chance , ”
44619	44634	44612	44612	Sibier	31	“ But first , we need to steal that equipment from the Darkened Dawn . ”
44660	44665	44651	44651	he	31	“ I ’m in . ”
45186	45190	45191	45191	Trent	31	“ Heavens above , ”
45374	45381	45382	45382	he	186	“ I did n’t expect company , ”
45411	45414	45415	45415	he	186	“ Icar , ”
45426	45432	45415	45415	he	186	“ We need to talk ... ”
45472	45477	45464	45464	his	32	“ Indeed we do . ”
45550	45558	45537	45537	He	186	“ Find what you were looking for ? ”
45642	45647	45648	45648	Icar	32	“ No ? Pity , ”
45657	45682	45651	45651	his	32	“ Because after all these years , Trent , I finally found what I was looking for : a cure . The Trials worked . ”
45778	45791	45792	45792	he	32	“ It 's painful . Oh , it 's so delightfully painful , ”
45800	45831	45792	45792	he	32	“ You are going to endure Trial after Trial once my men fix your careless brilliance . You will administer them alone , as I ca n’t afford another accident . ”
45864	45869	45839	45839	Trent	31	“ As you wish . ”
45894	45902	45886	45886	Icar	32	“ I knew we would get along . ”
45903	45908	45909	45909	Trent	31	“ We do n’t , ”
45913	45918	45909	45909	Trent	31	“ I hate you . ”
45929	45939	45924	45925	King Icar	32	” You saw the letters , did n’t you ? ”
45970	45977	45978	45978	Icar	32	“ They ’re from the Heti , ”
45981	46036	45978	45978	Icar	32	“ They are demanding more and more , and we do n’t have enough food to pay the monthly tribute . We need more time to run more Trials . And so , we are going to need food to pay the tribute . You are going to steal it from the Darkened Dawn . ”
46092	46097	46084	46084	he	31	“ With your men ? ”
46107	46114	46115	46115	he	32	“ Take whatever men you need , ”
46118	46137	46115	46115	he	32	“ I want you to make them hurt . Take all of their food stockpiles if you can . ”
46207	46213	46214	46214	Trent	31	“ I ’ll break through , ”
46221	46231	46217	46217	his	31	“ and I wo n’t leave them a scrap . ”
46249	46259	46240	46240	his	32	“ You ’re terrified , are n’t you Trent ? ”
46284	46306	46307	46307	He	32	“ Your compliance is a nice change and now we both get what we want : we ’ll save this kingdom . ”
46314	46343	46310	46310	his	32	“ Though Trent , I want you to understand one thing clearly : if you do another thing to cross me again , your mother will be first . ”
46370	46377	46378	46378	he	31	“ You wo n’t touch her , ”
46386	46397	46378	46378	he	31	“ And now we ’re back to how we were , ”
46401	46417	46398	46398	Icar	32	“ I wo n’t touch her , just as you wo n’t defy orders again . ”
46486	46521	46522	46522	he	74	“ What that boy did , no one has done before — he would have died if you had n’t pulled him out . For that stupidity of yours , I am begrudgingly grateful , ”
46530	46544	46522	46522	he	74	“ But you will never ever do something like that again . Understood ? ”
46582	46586	46575	46575	he	31	“ I understand . ”
46592	46640	46589	46589	Icar	32	“ We will need to build off of the boy ’s success from these Trials before the Heti feel our tributes dwindle . And you are going to need to find that boy and bring him to me for my experiments . Failure is not an option . ”
46681	46697	46698	46698	Icar	32	“ I ca n’t . The Darkened Dawn attacked , and Karia escaped with him . ”
46705	46713	46714	46714	Trent	31	“ The Darkened Dawn saw the boy ? ”
46730	46736	46737	46737	He	32	“ Blast the stars above ! ”
46760	46768	46750	46750	he	32	“ Do you know where they went ? ”
46769	46772	46781	46781	his	31	“ No , ”
46798	46814	46815	46815	Icar	32	“ Then it is in your best interest to find out , is it not ? ”
46826	46835	46818	46818	He	32	“ You said Karia went with the boy ? ”
46929	46932	46926	46926	he	31	“ Yes . ”
46945	46948	46949	46949	Icar	32	“ Guards ! ”
46993	47004	46982	46982	his	32	“ Bring Sasha here . We will be needing her . ”
47005	47008	47009	47009	Trent	31	“ No ! ”
47149	47156	47157	47157	He	31	“ Why are they getting her ? ”
47173	47185	47170	47170	his	32	“ You need a little motivation to do the right thing . ”
47186	47192	47193	47193	Trent	31	“ If you touch her , ”
47203	47215	47196	47196	his	31	“ I will not stop until one of us is dead . ”
47222	47269	47216	47216	Icar	32	“ I wo n’t . Spend the day with her , Trent and then decide if you want her to live . Cripple the Darkened Dawn and find the boy , or continue to fight fruitlessly and watch your family starve . The choice is yours . ”

47452	47459	47447	47447	Trent	31	“ You ca n’t control me . ”
47469	47505	47460	47460	Icar	32	“ Control you ? I ’ve never intended to . You ’re too wild , too driven by your misguided emotions . I only want you to see that we ’re on the same side . ”
47517	47525	47526	47526	he	32	“ I want to save this kingdom , ”
47529	47534	47526	47526	he	32	“ Just like you . ”
47562	47604	47556	47557	several guards	1170	“ I know you do n’t believe me , but the Skies themselves placed me here for a reason : they knew that I would do what no one else could . That I would do what no one else would . ”

47711	47717	47701	47701	she	1172	“ you ’ve grown rugged ! ”

48003	48010	48000	48000	he	31	“ But where are the others ? ”
48011	48014	48015	48015	Sasha	34	“ Occupied , ”
48033	48043	48026	48026	she	256	“ Come , I want to show you something . ”
48044	48047	48048	48048	Trent	31	“ Occupied ? ”
48056	48061	48048	48048	Trent	31	“ Occupied doing what ? ”
48062	48066	48067	48067	Sasha	34	“ Normal tasks , ”
48074	48090	48070	48070	her	256	“ Are you coming , Trent ? Icar only gave me a day with you . ”
48140	48148	48137	48137	Trent	31	“ Are they being tortured , Sasha ? ”
48164	48172	48173	48173	she	256	“ No , it 's not that , ”
48177	48182	48173	48173	she	256	“ Skies ! Icar … ”
48183	48186	48187	48187	Sasha	34	“ Trent ! ”
48197	48219	48187	48187	Sasha	34	“ Do n’t let it ruin today . You need this time to be happy . Your pain is destroying you ! ”
48260	48266	48253	48253	his	31	“ Okay . I will . ”
48267	48271	48253	48253	his	31	“ Thank you . ”
48272	48276	48277	48277	Trent	31	“ But Sasha , ”
48281	48304	48277	48277	Trent	31	“ I will find a way to get us all out of this and I ’ll never let this happen ever again . ”
48343	48368	48335	48335	Trent	31	“ Skies , one day all those who hurt us now will bow to us ! By the stars above , I promise it . ”
48386	48391	48379	48379	Her	1181	“ Are you coming ? ”
48392	48395	48396	48396	Trent	31	“ Yes , ”
48399	48406	48396	48396	Trent	31	“ Where are you taking me ? ”
48407	48412	48413	48413	she	1181	“ You ’ll see , ”
48778	48786	48787	48787	she	1195	“ Do n’t start a fight here , ”
48790	48794	48787	48787	she	1195	“ Come on ! ”
49237	49242	49243	49243	she	256	“ Race you there , ”
49445	49449	49450	49450	he	31	“ Exhausted already ? ”
49458	49461	49462	49462	she	256	“ See , ”
49465	49472	49462	49462	she	256	“ You look much better now . ”
49532	49539	49540	49540	she	256	“ Put it behind you Trent , ”
49543	49550	49551	49551	Trent	31	“ Besides , we 're here . ”
49570	49577	49551	49551	Trent	31	“ Here ? There 's only — ”
49578	49584	49585	49585	Sasha	34	“ No , not here . ”
49592	49595	49585	49585	Sasha	34	“ Dimwit . ”
49609	49619	49604	49604	Sasha	34	“ Did n’t you just say we ’re here ? ”
49620	49628	49629	49629	Sasha	34	“ And are you always this literal ? ”
49639	49645	49629	49629	Sasha	34	“ Can you push that ? ”
49646	49654	49604	49604	Sasha	34	“ What is this ? A challenge ? ”
49655	49660	49661	49661	Sasha	34	“ Just do it , ”
49664	49673	49674	49674	Trent	31	“ Do you always question everything anybody says ? ”
49677	49684	49674	49674	Trent	31	“ You ’re not just anybody . ”
49685	49697	49698	49698	Sasha	34	“ So are you going to move the rock or not ? ”
49701	49705	49698	49698	Sasha	34	“ For somebody ? ”
49719	49726	49734	49734	he	31	“ For my sister , Sasha . ”
49772	49777	49778	49778	Trent	31	“ What is this ? ”
49788	49800	49801	49801	Trent	31	“ What I wanted to show you , dummy . Obviously . ”
49806	49810	49801	49801	Trent	31	“ Which is … ”
49824	49840	49841	49841	She	1226	“ You are just going to have to wait and see , are n’t you ? ”
49895	49900	49901	49901	Sasha	34	“ Look at this , ”
50009	50016	50017	50017	she	1226	“ It 's magnificent , Trent , ”
50021	50026	50017	50017	she	1226	“ is n’t it ? ”
50050	50053	50054	50054	Trent	31	“ Yes , ”
50058	50062	50054	50054	Trent	31	“ It is . ”
50063	50071	50072	50072	Sasha	34	“ Selean and I discovered this before — ”
50080	50097	50072	50072	Sasha	34	“ We discovered this nearly three days ago . It ’s been my favorite place since . ”
50098	50104	50054	50054	Trent	31	“ I can see why . ”
50105	50118	50119	50119	Sasha	34	“ Does n’t this convince you that there is still good left ? ”
50127	50146	50122	50122	her	1226	“ Does n’t this make you want to keep going , despite all the malice in the world ? ”
50213	50216	50217	50217	he	31	“ No , ”
50224	50228	50217	50217	he	31	“ Not anymore . ”
50250	50259	50260	50260	Trent	31	“ If this is all that motivated me , ”
50263	50291	50292	50292	He	31	“ I ’d step off this cliff right now . This sight is beautiful , yes , but it ’s hollow . It gives me no meaning . ”
50308	50321	50298	50298	his	31	“ Sasha , this ca n’t undo the things I ’ve done . ”
50357	50369	50370	50370	he	31	“ I do n’t know if I made the right choice , ”
50377	50390	50370	50370	he	31	“ I ’ve ruined families , but I ’ve saved my own . ”
50409	50421	50391	50391	He	31	“ Tell me , Sasha ... what would you have done ? ”
50442	50447	50448	50448	she	1226	“ Does it matter ? ”
50452	50491	50448	50448	she	1226	“ What ’s done is done . What ’s important is that you do n’t give up . A wise rebellion leader once told me , ‘ You are only defeated once you ’ve surrendered your hope . ’ ”
50609	50615	50616	50616	Trent	31	“ What happened to Selean ? ”
50628	50635	50620	50620	Sasha	34	“ Nothing . She ’s fine . ”
50652	50661	50662	50662	Trent	31	“ You ’re a terrible liar , Sasha , ”
50671	50686	50662	50662	Trent	31	“ The family is n’t really locked up in their room , are they ? ”
50706	50713	50694	50694	her	1226	“ No , they are n’t . ”
50731	50756	50694	50694	her	1226	“ Icar killed them , did n’t he ? You were going to say ‘ before they were killed , ’ were n’t you ? ”
50797	50800	50801	50801	he	31	“ Skies , ”
50804	50812	50801	50801	he	31	“ To the depths with this all ! ”
50813	50817	50818	50818	Sasha	34	“ Trent stop ! ”
50840	50848	50849	50849	she	1226	“ No , they are n’t dead , ”
50866	50881	50849	50849	she	1226	“ But Selean would be if it was n’t for the kingdom ’s help . ”
50889	50923	50849	50849	she	1226	“ Trent , she almost died from the necfas — just like our brother . The doctors are always with her , and mom and dad could n’t bear to leave her side . ”
50924	50931	50932	50932	Trent	31	“ Why are we here then ! ”
50939	50946	50932	50932	Trent	31	“ We should be with them ! ”
50959	50990	50991	50991	Trent	31	“ We ca n’t , Trent . The doctors wo n’t let anyone else near her — they barely tolerate our parents . Selean is already at too much risk . ”
51032	51038	51025	51025	Sasha	34	“ Is she going to … ”
51078	51088	51065	51065	He	31	“ Is she going to die like our brother ? ”
51089	51096	51097	51097	Sasha	34	“ The doctors do n’t know , ”
51104	51139	51100	51100	her	35	“ She was going to die , but then King Icar showed up with this vial of strange medicine . If he had n’t given it to her , Selean would already be dead . ”
51153	51160	51149	51149	her	35	“ You saved her , Trent . ”
51172	51189	51167	51167	her	35	“ No , I did n’t . I ’ve condemned us all to lives of misery . ”
51190	51200	51201	51201	Trent	31	“ Do n’t say that ! Selean still lives ! ”
51216	51219	51220	51220	he	31	“ No , ”
51227	51252	51220	51220	he	31	“ because now Icar knows that I ’m indebted to him . He knows that I wo n’t try to break you all free . ”
51264	51276	51253	51253	His	31	“ Now I have no choice but to go after Sibier . ”
51293	51298	51299	51299	Trent	31	“ Who is Sibier ? ”
51319	51335	51299	51299	Trent	31	“ He ’s me , Sasha . He ’s the man I used to be . ”
52970	52974	52975	52975	he	34	“ Blast it ! ”
55319	55325	55326	55326	he	34	“ Get away from me , ”
55457	55464	55465	55465	he	34	“ I ’m sorry , Karia , ”
55469	55484	55465	55465	he	34	“ I do n’t know … I do n’t know what came over me . ”
55496	55505	55493	55493	he	34	“ I did n’t mean to kill him . ”
55526	55531	55532	55532	she	36	“ You ’re okay , ”
55535	55557	55532	55532	she	36	“ With Werrin injured , I do n’t know if we can take both of the Darkened Dawn as prisoners anyways . ”
55665	55668	55669	55669	Karia	36	“ Sibier — ”
55679	55684	55673	55673	her	36	“ I ’m alright , ”
55696	55701	55690	55690	his	34	“ Let ’s go . ”
55726	55737	55738	55738	she	36	“ We can at least take the man ’s cloak , ”
55741	55750	55751	55751	Stiffly	78	“ And can you bring the other one ? ”
55925	55937	55915	55915	his	56	“ Let 's give him a proper burial , should we ? ”
55985	56011	56012	56012	He	56	“ Whether this man ’s ash becomes a star in the heavens or sinks to the bottom of the ocean , he had fought well . ”
56019	56037	56012	56012	He	56	“ If you place him there , the stalks will burn hot enough to send his ash heavenward ”
56472	56488	56459	56459	he	34	“ We have to stop the flames . We ca n’t let this food burn . ”
56498	56513	56491	56491	his	56	“ No , we will let it burn . The Darkened Dawn needs this . ”
56514	56519	56520	56520	Sibier	34	“ Are you serious ? ”
56528	56534	56520	56520	Sibier	34	“ The people need this ! ”
56553	56556	56557	56557	he	56	“ Sibier , ”
56566	56581	56582	56582	He	56	“ Do not question me . This food would never have reached the people . ”
56713	56728	56729	56729	She	36	“ We need to go . The Darkened Dawn will see the smoke soon . ”
56759	56767	56729	56729	She	36	“ Sibier , help Werrin get out . ”
58400	58403	58404	58404	Trent	31	“ Skies , ”
58416	58423	58404	58404	Trent	31	“ Come on … do it ! ”
58619	58623	58624	58625	the man	466	“ Help me ! ”
58836	58840	58841	58841	Trent	31	“ Behind you ! ”
58967	58970	58971	58971	Trent	31	“ NO ! ”
59241	59244	59224	59224	he	466	“ Skies , ”
59250	59259	59245	59245	Trent	31	“ he ’s surviving . It 's working . ”
59427	59430	59431	59431	Trent	31	“ No ! ”
59476	59478	59472	59472	Icar	32	“ resurrection ”
59658	59672	59638	59638	She	36	“ Are you going to try to save him like you saved Icar ? ”
59939	59949	59921	59921	her	36	“ This is for your own good , love . ”
60898	60948	60949	60949	I	0	” Her face , contorted in pleading agony , was seared into his memory — the same face she had that night . Once again , Trent relived the absolute pain he had felt that moment he had chosen to save Icar . That moment he had betrayed her . “
60961	61273	60957	60957	you	36	” Trent ’s heart went cold . His hand found the final switches , his resolve hardening as the weight of her words crushed down on him . He flipped off the last coolant . Then , with unholy determination , he flipped off everything except the Trials . The room ’s temperature began to rise , a suffocating heat that matched the turmoil inside him . His fingers trembled as they found the dial , but there was no hesitation as he turned it the rest of the way . Immediately , the instruments in front of him began to burn his hands , the heat searing his skin as the cooling systems failed . All the lights on the control board blinked out . Metal shrieked as it grinded metal , the sound of the Trials tearing themselves apart . Trent ’s breath caught in his throat as he watched the spectacle unfold . Flashes of lightning illuminated the scene in harsh , staccato bursts , casting monstrous shadows on the walls . The mist , now a churning maelstrom , tore through the man , twisting his flesh into something otherworldly — a purple film that shimmered and writhed like a living nightmare . Across the room , Karia ’s spectral face lingered for a moment longer , her expression locked in an eternal plea . And then , with a final , agonizing pull , the mist consumed her , dragging her into oblivion . The man ’s screams abruptly cut off . His eyes rolled back into his head . The torrential mist halted . His glow disappeared . The chamber fell into deathly silence . Everything stopped . The High Executioner stilled , his heart frozen in his chest . With unmistakably horror , he now watched the twitching fingers of the man ’s corpse . “

62745	62751	62755	62755	his	31	“ I do n’t care , ”
62775	62807	62771	62771	he	31	“ Skies ! This is not how we are supposed to be building a better world ! What ’s the point of all this if we ’re no better than them ? ”

63910	63921	63922	63922	Karia	36	“ There ’s just one thing we do n’t know , ”
63928	63941	63922	63922	Karia	36	“ You ’ll tell us , and we ’ll let you go . ”
63967	63979	63980	63980	Karia	36	“ Let ’s start with the Trials to catch you up , ”
63995	64003	63983	63983	her	36	“ Have you heard about the boy ? ”
64011	64032	64004	64007	The Darkened Dawn member	987	“ You mean the rumors ? The boy who survived ? The one we ’re supposed to catch for tribute ? ”
64052	64074	64046	64046	Karia	36	“ Yes , that ’s right . And you ’ve heard that they plan to take him to them as well ? ”
64143	64153	64154	64155	the prisoner	1583	“ We found a way to traverse the depths ? ”
64162	64172	64154	64155	the prisoner	1583	“ I thought ... they always came to us . ”
64269	64326	64256	64256	her	36	“ I would n’t expect you to know that . After all , our spies never reported you in any of the inner - circle meetings . Anyways , at the tip of the Island Esther[au ] reaches into the depths . It did n’t take long for the Darkened Dawn to find a way down . ”
64425	64435	64419	64419	her	36	“ Your leader was the first to do it . ”
64436	64439	64440	64441	The prisoner	1583	“ Orion ? ”
64457	64475	64447	64447	her	36	“ Stop wasting my time with your ignorance . No , the leader of the Darkened Dawn . ”
64476	64479	64480	64481	the man	466	“ Oh , ”
65344	65347	65348	65348	she	196	“ Sibier , ”
65365	65378	65348	65348	she	196	“ the Heavens teach us that we must be good to everyone . ”
65402	65405	65406	65406	she	196	“ Sibier , ”
65409	65499	65406	65406	she	196	“ you know about the sense — that feeling deep inside you — that scriptures speak so much about . That sense to do good , that pull towards kindness , is the real you . You are not anything else . You are not the labels the guards degrade you with . You are not your body . You are n’t even your thoughts whether good or bad . Sibier , that sense is you — it is the soul that the stars have made your body for . ”
65569	65572	65573	65573	she	196	“ Sibier , ”
65579	65597	65573	65573	she	196	“ never betray that sense . Never betray your soul . Never betray who you truly are . ”
65598	65604	65605	65605	he	31	“ I wo n’t mom , ”
66723	66730	66731	66731	she	36	“ You had an eventful day , ”
66734	66740	66731	66731	she	36	“ I bet your overwhelmed . ”
66752	66755	66756	66756	he	31	“ Yeah , ”
66778	66789	66790	66790	she	36	“ I remember when I had first felt that way , ”
66799	66843	66844	66844	Karia	36	“ It was nearly four years ago . Back then , my family ran a rather successful toy store . My father was a skilled carver , and was often hired out by some of the wealthiest barons and dukes in the kingdom . ”
66847	66936	66844	66844	Karia	36	“ Back then , I had everything I could have wanted for myself as I managed our store and delivered the toys . I noticed back then the kids who did n’t have any , and how they would look longingly at me as I passed on the street . Pretty soon , I started giving a few of the toys I was supposed to deliver to them , and would tell my father I had lost them . At first , he would shrug and make more . ”
66949	66957	66958	66958	Karia	36	“ Why are you telling me this ? ”
66961	67017	66958	66958	Karia	36	“ Because I thought you should know . Anyways , like I am stubborn today , I was stubborn back then . One of the daughters of the dukes saw that I was doing this told her father , who in turn threatened my father to ‘ get a reign on his devilish daughter . ’ ”
67028	67046	67021	67021	Karia	36	“ My father in turn demanded that I stop giving away toys . But I would n’t . ”
67054	67100	67101	67101	she	36	“ The next time I gave away toys , the duke ordered me arrested . I remember the kingdom guard 's pounding on our door , and my father answered . I can still see the grim expression that came across his face . Sibier , ”
67106	67122	67101	67101	she	36	“ he did n’t even have tears in his eyes when he handed me over . “
67132	67142	67143	67143	I	0	” She paused , as emotion filled her voice . “
67183	67189	67174	67174	I	0	“ Eventually they caught me . ”
67196	67234	67235	67235	She	36	“ I waited in a cell for what must have been a week before the Baron and my father came down . His head was heavily bandaged , and I tried to tell him I was sorry . ”
67244	67282	67235	67235	She	36	“ He did n’t care . The Baron suggested I be taken to the Trials for my rebellion , and all my father said was ‘ I agree ’ . He did n’t even fight for me . ”
67311	67316	67317	67317	he	31	“ I ’m sorry , ”
67320	67327	67317	67317	he	31	“ I imagine you were devastated . ”
67331	67395	67328	67328	Karia	36	“ That ’s for sure . Luckily for me though as the guards were taking me to the Trials , it had been when Trent first started to rescue those sent there . I will never forget how he burst from the shadows , and saved my life . I had nowhere to go , and so I decided I would help him . ”
67396	67401	67402	67402	Sibier	31	“ I ’m sorry . ”
67436	67472	67426	67426	Karia	36	“ So I do know what it feels like to be a prisoner Sibier . Sometimes I fear I have my Dad ’s ruthlessness , but the Darkened Dawn had answers we needed to know . ”
67502	67507	67483	67483	He	31	“ I forgive you . ”
67508	67511	67514	67514	Karia	36	“ Thanks . ”
67524	67567	67568	67568	Sibier	31	“ He told us some important things . Apparently the Darkened Dawn and King Icar are after the same thing : something the man called the resurrection . It had something to do with the mist from yesterday , and those Tri[ay]als . ”
67573	67578	67568	67568	Sibier	31	“ What is it ? ”
67579	67598	67599	67599	Karia	36	“ The man did n’t know exactly . He mentioned it was their key to overthrowing the king , ”
67630	67655	67620	67620	Karia	36	“ If we could figure out what this ‘ resurrection ’ means and discover before they do , it might give us an edge . ”
67677	67687	67688	67688	he	31	“ That does n’t affect what we 're doing , ”
67691	67701	67688	67688	he	31	“ Did you find a way into their storehouses ? ”
67705	67721	67702	67702	Karia	36	“ Of course I did . I already have a plan to raid it too . ”
68026	68036	68037	68037	he	56	“ I ’ve waited a long time for this , ”
68068	68077	68078	68078	Sibier	31	“ Do you think we ’ll get caught ? ”
68163	68167	68144	68144	Her	36	“ We might , ”
68409	68417	68391	68391	His	1695	“ What are you doing with him ? ”
68503	68508	68509	68509	Werrin	56	“ We got him , ”
68574	68578	68585	68585	his	987	“ Show me , ”
68715	68719	68720	68723	the Darkened Dawn member	987	“ Come inside , ”
68739	68755	68720	68723	the Darkened Dawn member	987	“ But why did you come here … instead of going directly to the Master ? ”
68836	68838	68850	68850	Werrin	56	“ Master ”
68884	68896	68897	68897	Werrin	56	“ You expect us to risk the security of our tribute , ”
68903	68917	68897	68897	Werrin	56	“ by traveling all that way at night ? You ’re a fool . ”
68990	69004	68982	68984	The Darkened Dawn	41	“ I meant to send word to the Master . Not travel there . ”
69013	69026	69005	69005	Werrin	56	“ Are you always this shortsighted ? What if it was intercepted ? ”
69027	69030	69044	69044	his	56	“ I — ”
69031	69035	69036	69036	Werrin	56	“ Do n’t , ”
69050	69078	69044	69044	his	56	“ Get the others manning this storehouse . I want everyone prepared to help us escort the Tribute to the Master . No excuses . No delays . ”
69160	69163	69164	69164	Karia	36	“ Sibier , ”
69170	69175	69164	69164	Karia	36	“ open your eyes . ”
69551	69556	69539	69539	He	31	“ This ’ll do . ”
70048	70058	70059	70059	he	31	“ I think we ’ve given them enough time , ”
70137	70142	70143	70143	she	36	“ I ’m ready , ”
70268	70274	70275	70275	he	56	“ Alright , start running , ”
70298	70301	70302	70302	he	56	“ HELP ! ”
70313	70322	70323	70323	He	56	“ The Rebellion ’s come here for the — ”
70545	70551	70552	70555	one of the men	1734	“ Did you hear that ? ”
70558	70564	70552	70555	one of the men	1734	“ Where ’d they go ? ”
70610	70621	70622	70623	one voice	1737	“ Heavens above , they ’re escaping around the bend ! ”
70943	70948	70949	70949	he	31	“ Let ’s go , ”
70952	70958	70949	70949	he	31	“ Before they come back . ”
71620	71630	71635	71635	her	36	“ Tonight is a perfect night for this raid , ”
71644	71661	71635	71635	her	36	“ The full moon , the stars — like they ’re lighting the way for us . ”
71687	71698	71666	71666	she	36	“ But it ’s perfect because I ’m with you . ”
71782	71801	71765	71765	her	36	“ The flower is my promise . We ’ll go together , and we ’ll come back together . ”
72534	72540	72541	72541	Trent	31	" After me , men ! "
72614	72649	72650	72650	Trent	31	“ And the stars shall be stricken with grief , and shall be tram[bj]pled under the feet of men , treated as things of naught . Darkness will be a blanket over their minds . ”
73195	73196	73191	73191	They	200	” “
73202	73312	73191	73191	They	200	” Trent muttered as he swung . The victim did n’t even have time to draw her weapon . Not far behind Trent , his men surged out from the forest , their voices echoing his cry as they swept into the valley like a tidal wave . Karia had already seized a fallen weapon , her stance shifting into a familiar readiness . The last two cultists glanced at each other , outnumbered twenty - to - two , and dropped their weapons without a fight . Trent wiped the sweat from his brow , breathing heavily . He turned to his men , nodding toward the prisoners . “
73317	73404	73405	73405	Karia	36	” he ordered , his voice sharp , but his gaze was already drifting back to Karia . He sheathed his sword , but his heart was still pounding for a different reason . He remembered those condemning words she spoke to him in the priso[bk]n : Am I not family to you ? I had trusted you … I ’m not sure I should anymore . Go Away ! Leave me alone . Trent did n’t know seeing her again would rip at his heart . “
73407	73416	73405	73405	Karia	36	” he breathed , his voice almost breaking . “
73428	73462	73420	73420	I	0	” Karia ’s eyes flickered , her expression a storm of conflicting emotions . She touched her head , wincing slightly as her fingers came away sticky with blood . Her gaze hardened . “
73469	73480	73465	73465	you	36	” she demanded , the edge in her tone unmistakable . “
73487	73500	73483	73483	you	36	” Trent raised his eyebrows , taken aback by her brazen bitterness . “
73515	73519	73513	73513	Karia	36	” Karia grimaced . “
73533	73633	73634	73634	I	0	” Trent ’s fingers hesitated on the fragile flower , as it weighed heavily against him . He saw something detached in Karia ’s eyes , a hurt that was a fissure into her soul . It felt … it felt so familiar . It was that same look she had when she told him about her father ’s betrayal . But it also felt so different . Now that gaze , that pain , was directed towards him . Accusing him . Furious at him . Trent dropped the petal back into his pocket , folding his arms . “
73640	73652	73638	73638	Karia	36	” Karia interrupted him , spitting her very words like ice . “
73660	73672	73658	73658	Trent	31	” She stepped forwards , her bloody finger pointing at him . “
73692	73766	73767	73767	Karia	36	” Trent ’s heart stopped , his blood freezing in his veins . The air was thick with tension as those words hung heavy , the silence stretching between them . Slowly , his hands inched once again to the flower in his pocket , and tenderly lifted it out . Its petals were crushed and the stem bent , but Trent held it out to her as if it were a jewel . “
73769	73779	73767	73767	Karia	36	” he began , his voice quieter , softer . “
73785	73858	73781	73781	you	36	” He did n’t know what else to say . Karia ’s gaze dropped to the flower , her eyes lingering on it before lifting to meet his . There was a flicker of something — pain , maybe even longing — but it was buried beneath layers of guarded distance . She still held her finger to his nose . Trent swallowed , words tumbling out before he could stop them . “
73901	73912	73913	73913	You	36	” He broke off , struggling to hold her gaze . “
73930	73989	73990	73990	Skies	33	” Karia ’s face softened , but her lips remained pressed into a tight line . The vulnerability in her eyes was fleeting , replaced by a wary bitterness . She lowered her arm . Trent took a shaky breath , gathering his courage , and placed the flower in her hands , wrapping his fingers around hers . “
74036	74089	74092	74092	we	1803	” For a moment , Karia ’s expression cracked . Her lips trembled , the way they always did when she was holding back tears , and Trent ’s heart ached to pull her into an embrace . When she spoke , her voice was barely a whisper , fragile and uncertain . “
74105	74190	74191	74191	I	0	” He looked over his shoulder at his men , who stood awkwardly , their expressions a mix of unease and impatience . Trent could feel their discomfort , their silent judgment of Karia , the lingering distrust they held toward her . Despite wanting to keep this moment private , he knew he could n’t : these men did n’t trust him , but he owed her honesty now , even if it was in front of his — no , the kings’—men . “
74199	74212	74191	74191	I	0	” he admitted , his voice steady but full of raw truth . “
74254	74267	74191	74191	I	0	” He tried to smile , though it barely reached his eyes . “
74274	74301	74191	74191	I	0	” Karia let out a short , bitter laugh , her eyes glinting with skepticism . She stepped back , pulling her hand away from Trent . “
74304	74319	74191	74191	I	0	” she repeated , her voice laced with something between sarcasm and genuine sorrow . “
74326	74334	74191	74191	I	0	” He held her gaze , unflinching . “
74367	74385	74358	74358	you	0	” He rubbed his thumb against his palm , feeling the rough calluses but also the scars . “
74404	74472	74395	74395	you	1805	” Karia stared at him , her gaze intense and searching . The silence stretched between them , her expression wavering as she looked down at the crushed flower in her hands . For a long , breathless moment , she said nothing , and Trent ’s heart pounded with a mixture of fear and anticipation . Finally , she spoke , her voice a mere whisper . “
74476	74513	74395	74395	you	1805	” she said , the word hanging in the air like something precious and fragile . But then , her eyes widened in sudden realization , a jolt of urgency snapping her out of the moment . “
74519	74528	74517	74517	Trent	31	” She cursed , her tone shifting instantly . “
74540	74550	74395	74395	you	1805	” Trent blinked , bewildered by the abrupt change . “
74553	74575	74576	74576	I	0	” Without another word , Karia grabbed him by the wrist , her grip firm and unyielding , yanking him forward . “
74583	74583	74576	74576	I	0	”
74816	74821	74810	74810	his	56	“ We found it . ”
75039	75042	75043	75043	Werrin	56	“ Sibier . ”
75055	75059	75043	75043	Werrin	56	“ The key . ”
75286	75300	75275	75275	Werrin	56	“ Sibier , get out of the way and let my men work . ”
75330	75336	75337	75337	Werrin	56	“ Go lock the entrance , ”
75340	75353	75337	75337	Werrin	56	“ Make sure no one from the Darkened Dawn comes this way . ”
75354	75357	75358	75358	Sibier	31	“ Right , ”
75732	75737	75741	75741	his	31	“ They ’re coming ! ”
75810	75814	75815	75815	he	56	“ Use this ! ”
75886	75890	75891	75891	Werrin	56	“ Blast it ! ”
75994	75997	75998	75998	Werrin	56	“ Sibier ! ”
76133	76136	76137	76137	Werrin	56	“ Sibier ! ”
76444	76457	76458	76458	he	56	“ What … what in the depths were you doing , Sibier ? ”
76771	76779	76780	76781	the man	466	“ How ’d you get that cloak ? ”
77027	77034	77039	77039	his	1794	“ You ’ve never fought before , ”
77058	77065	77049	77049	he	31	“ Why are you even here ? ”
77080	77086	77087	77087	he	31	“ I have fought before , ”
77827	77830	77819	77819	Werrin	56	“ Sibier ! ”
77876	77892	77869	77869	His	560	“ We ca n’t run . They ’ve blocked the exit . Stand and fight . ”
78234	78244	78245	78245	Trent	31	“ The Stars will Shine in the Day of Destruction ”
79871	79878	79855	79855	his	32	" Bring that boy to me . "
79886	79893	79894	79894	Icar	32	" Bring that boy to me . "
80087	80092	80093	80093	he	31	“ Arrest that boy , ”
80140	80143	80144	80144	she	36	“ Trent , ”
80151	80198	80144	80144	she	36	“ Trent ’s resolve wavered for a fraction of a second . A flicker of doubt flashed in his eyes , but it was swallowed by a surge of anger . His composure shattered like glass , and his voice exploded with raw , unchecked fury . “
80202	80212	80213	80215	ARREST THAT BOY	87	” he roared , his face contorted with rage . “
80217	80243	80213	80215	ARREST THAT BOY	87	” The room was silent . Then all at once , Trent ’s men surged forward . Then the captain stood , drawing his sword . “
80250	80250	80213	80215	ARREST THAT BOY	87	”
80610	80614	80615	80615	he	1989	“ You soldiers , ”
80626	80652	80615	80615	he	1989	“ are under my command now . Capture the boy , or I ’ll kill every last one of you like the traitors you are . ”
80689	80693	80697	80697	his	56	“ The boy , ”
80703	80710	80697	80697	his	56	“ is already under my command . ”

81057	81064	81020	81020	his	31	“ Do n’t you love me ? ”
81278	81284	81285	81285	he	31	“ I ’m not moving , ”
81300	81311	81285	81285	he	31	“ My men are taking the boy and this food . ”
81326	81329	81330	81331	the man	466	“ Captain … ”
81354	81361	81362	81362	Trent	31	“ This is your last chance , ”
81369	81373	81362	81362	Trent	31	“ Step aside . ”
82246	82270	82244	82244	Sibier	31	” the captain ordered , his tone unyielding . His gaze never left Trent ’s . Sibier ’s fingers tightened around the sword . “
82273	82286	82287	82287	You	31	” Werrin repeated , his tone unquestioning , looking back at Sibier . “
82294	82397	82398	82398	Men	4339	” Sibier met Werrin ’s eyes , seeing the well of compassion there . Real , unyielding compassion . It was n’t the hardened resolve of a soldier or the calculated look of a man weighing strategy . It was raw . It was human . Sibier felt tears come to his face , a hot sensation coming over him . It did n’t make sense . Stars above , Sibier thought from the bottom of his heart , bless this man ! The High Executioner ’s terse voice made Sibier flinch , wrenching the feeling of warmth with his bitter cold . “
82400	82406	82287	82287	You	31	” the High Executioner commanded , “
82411	82501	82408	82409	that boy	4344	” The High Executioner ’s men stepped forwards . Werrin took a wary step back . Then , the men ripped their swords from their scabbards . Panic filled Sibier ’s chest . A hand grabbed Sibier from behind , and he screamed . He spun around , heart hammering , ready to fight . But instead of an attacker , he found one of Werrin ’s men standing behind him — a reassuring presence . The man ’s voice was low but firm , brimming with quiet courage . “
82508	82537	82502	82502	We	2080	” he said , his words both a threat and a promise . He raised his blade slightly , meeting the High Executioner ’s men with a glare . “
82548	82765	82538	82538	You	2081	” For a moment , the room froze . The High Executioner ’s men faltered , their forward momentum halting . Their eyes darted between each other , then to the soldiers who now stood with Werrin . They outnumbered them , yes — but these were men who had bled together , who had fought side by side , who had trusted each other with their lives . Breaking that bond would n’t be as simple as drawing steel . Sibier ’s breath hitched in his chest . He watched in disbelief as Werrin ’s men shifted into a protective formation around him , shields of flesh and steel . They did n’t have to . None of them had to . Yet here they were , risking their lives for him . For him . Werrin smirked , a faint , almost imperceptible curve of his lips . He glanced at the soldier who had spoken , nodding slightly in approval . For the first time , Sibier felt a surge of what he felt when he saw Werrin with his family — admiration . This is the dream . These are the people I need for the dream . Seeing his men ’s hesitation , the High Executioner ’s face twisted with fury . “
82775	82779	82766	82766	I	0	” Werrin scowled . “
82790	82807	82783	82783	you	0	” He scoffed , dry from his throat , a rasping sound that held no fear . “
82814	82827	82783	82783	you	0	” The High Executioner narrowed his eyes , venom filling his words . “
82837	82847	82835	82835	Captain	4115	” he snarled , his voice low and dangerous . “
82856	82857	82848	82848	My	0	” “
82866	82875	82862	82862	you	0	” Werrin shot back , his voice rising . “
82896	82914	82889	82889	You	0	” He stepped forward , his sword still raised but his words cutting sharper than any blade . “
82937	82974	82930	82930	Trent	31	” The room held its breath as the High Executioner froze , his expression unreadable . When the High Executioner finally spoke it was barely above a whisper , but carried the weight of a storm . “
82985	82993	82975	82975	You	0	” The High Executioner punctuated every word . “
83002	83186	83187	83187	I	0	” The tension in the room was suffocating , the kind that made every breath feel labored . Sibier could see it — the shifting stances of the High Executioner ’s men , their growing uncertainty . Some glanced toward Werrin , then back to Trent . The lines between sides were blurring . Karia stood silent , with one hand resting on the hilt of her sword . Her body was poised like a lion ready to strike . She stared at Werrin with daggers in her eyes , but her lips remained tight . And no one seemed to be paying attention to him anymore — or the door . Sibier ’s eyes darted between the warring figures and his path to freedom , his breaths shallow and quick . He began to inch toward the exit , moving slowly , careful not to draw notice . If I can just slip out now … His heart pounded in his ears . I can run . Find Ilyian . Hide . Just run . Werrin ’s voice boomed through the cavern . “
83200	83205	83189	83189	I	0	” the captain spat . “
83222	83237	83238	83238	You	2087	” he said , nodding his head toward Karia who glared back at him . “
83244	83269	83242	83242	yourself	2087	” He turned to the High Executioner ’s men , his voice rising with conviction , as though daring them to defy their leader . “
83294	83302	83303	83303	You	2087	” The High Executioner ’s face darkened . “
83310	83324	83303	83303	You	2087	” He spoke evenly , somehow containing the emotion so close to bursting . “
83363	83390	83391	83393	Men like me	2101	” The High Executioner ’s men bit their lips at the remark , uncomfortable . A few glanced towards Werrin , uncertain who they should follow . “
83395	83420	83391	83393	Men like me	2101	” Werrin shot back , his voice dripping with indignation . He pointed towards all of the soldiers in the room , nearly shouting . “
83425	83459	83460	83460	Trent	31	“ Men who only try to feed their families ? Men who prevent riots from spilling blood in the streets ? Not everyone in the kingdom is from the depths , like you ! ”
83579	83585	83586	83586	He	384	“ Step aside , Captain . ”
83600	83617	83586	83586	He	384	“ I do n’t want to have to kill you . You ’re a good man . ”
83633	83649	83650	83650	he	56	“ I ’m not letting you have him . And if you attack me again , ”
83657	83673	83650	83650	he	56	“ we ’ll fight . We ’ll gang up , and we will kill you . ”
83674	83677	83678	83678	Karia	36	“ Werrin … ”
83726	83735	83736	83736	he	56	“ Even if you managed to kill me , ”
83740	83759	83736	83736	he	56	“ Icar would have you all hanged for treason . You ca n’t win that fight , Captain . ”
83760	83773	83774	83774	Werrin	56	“ Icar would celebrate us for killing the rebellion leader you are , ”
83777	83791	83774	83774	Werrin	56	“ You are n’t the High Executioner . We do n’t follow you . ”
83851	83863	83838	83838	he	182	“ Are you still trying to feed your family , Captain ? ”
83888	83895	83876	83878	The Rebellion Leader	182	“ To save them from starvation ? “
83901	83913	83876	83878	The Rebellion Leader	182	” he hissed , but his tone had lost its edge . “
83922	83940	83876	83878	The Rebellion Leader	182	” The Rebellion Leader ’s voice dropped lower , colder , as he walked unafraid towards Sibier . “
83951	83962	83945	83945	you	56	” The High Executioner 's eyes locked with Werrin ’s . “
83973	84383	83967	83967	you	56	” The words hung in the air as Werrin fumbled for a response , gritting his teeth . For the first time , Sibier saw a crack in the captain ’s resolve — not a weakness , but of uncertainty . Sibier ’s heart raced as Trent took another step toward him , his movements slow and deliberate , blocking the only path towards escape . The tension in the room was suffocating , each breath Sibier took feeling like it might shatter the fragile balance . Then Werrin lunged . And the High Executioner became a tempest of steel . His sword met Werrin ’s with a deafening crash , the force of the blow echoing through the cavern . He spun , pivoting on his heel with a grace that did n’t match his bulk , redirecting Werrin ’s blade to the ground . The captain stumbled , his feet skidding on loose gravel as the High Executioner loomed over him . Sibier sprinted for the door . Sibier ’s breaths came fast and shallow , his feet pounding against the stone floor as though he were separate from his own body . He felt mechanical , his legs moving out of instinct rather than will . Just run . Just run . In a swift move , the High Executioner broke Werrin ’s defense , sending the captain ’s blade skittering across stone . The captain stumbled back , falling to one knee . Sibier froze mid - stride , his heart screaming in his chest . The door was only feet away , just within reach , but the sight of Werrin on the ground , unarmed and vulnerable , rooted him in place . He saw the High Executioner raise his sword for the killing blow , the same cold , mechanical precision he had witnessed in his nightmares . In the back of his mind , he saw his father under that blade . I have to do something ! Sibier ’s breath hitched . He reached for the knife in his scabbard , but he came up empty . Once again , he did nothing to save the captain who had sacrificed himself for him . The High Executioner ’s blade came down . Then Karia burst forward , her blade meeting the High Executioner 's in a thunderous crash . The sound jolted Sibier , snapping him out of his paralysis . “
84386	84416	83967	83967	you	56	” Karia shouted over her shoulder , her voice raw and urgent . Her blade quivered against the High Executioner 's unyielding strength , her teeth bared in defiance . “
84419	84683	84686	84686	Sibier	31	” Sibier did n’t wait to see what happened next . He raced toward the door , shoving it open with trembling hands . The storm outside howled in greeting , cold rain pelting his face as thunder rolled across the mountains . The wind whipped at his clothes , like that night before ... A dark chill crawled down his spine , as tears filled Sibier ’s eyes . The night his parents died . He had n’t looked back then . And heavens above , he wished he had . With tears blurring his vision , Sibier turned . Inside the cavern , the scene was chaotic . With a swift movement , the High Executioner kicked out Karia ’s feet , sending her sprawling -- the same way the monster had sent Sibier ’s mother to the ground . Hate boiled in Sibier . Sibier ’s hair whipped at his head , feeling the wind howl behind him . It was cold , but it was nothing compared to the heat inside of him . He felt that rage turn dark , feeding his bitterness . Feeding the raw desire to destroy . His skin crackled near his curse , the veins in his palms glowing a sinister violet . [ bq ] The captain was on his feet again , his wrist twisted at an unnatural angle , his face pale and strained . He stumbled toward his fallen sword , his movements sluggish and pained . Yet , even now , there was something unyielding in his eyes . “
84688	84834	84686	84686	Sibier	31	” Werrin shouted , his voice hoarse but resolute . It cut through the chaos like a knife , piercing straight into Sibier ’s chest . For a moment , the captain ’s gaze locked with his , and Sibier saw something he had seen in his father ’s eyes that night . Save our dreams , his Fathers voice echoed . Save Ilyian . With those thoughts , the hate drained out of him . Leaving him empty . Sibier felt sick . The High Executioner turned to Werrin , his face hardened and unreadable . Werrin lunged for his sword but with mocking ease the High Executioner kicked the blade away . The captain staggered back , his wrist cradled against his chest , but he did n’t retreat . He stood tall , his gaze steady , his breathing labored but unbroken . “
84838	84853	84686	84686	Sibier	31	” Sibier whispered , feeling the cold bite of the weather in his skin , “
84861	84941	84686	84686	Sibier	31	” The High Executioner turned to Sibier , his face expressionless . He wore the same mask of death he had seen every night . In that gaze , Sibier felt so small , and the distance between them was n’t far enough . Five feet . The High Executioner lunged for Sibier , but Werrin jerked forward , catching the High Executioner ’s leg . Roaring , the Rebellion Leader backhanded the captain , sending the man sprawling . “
84947	84959	84945	84945	Captain	4115	” Trent warned , his voice cold and heavy with regret . “
84967	85137	84945	84945	Captain	4115	” Werrin did n’t listen . With his uninjured arm , he reached for a dagger strapped to his side and lunged at the High Executioner in a final act of defiance . Sibier ’s heart lurched as Trent stepped aside , catching Werrin ’s wrist with precision . In a fluid motion , Trent twisted the captain ’s arm , forcing him to drop the dagger . The blade clattered to the ground . Trent shoved Werrin backward , and the captain stumbled , his foot catching on his own fallen blade . His head cracked against the stone behind him.[br ] The cavern fell silent , save for the sound of rain and Sibier ’s ragged breathing . The captain did n’t move . Sibier ’s scream tore through the cavern . He stumbled back into the storm , his legs weak , his vision swimming . His gaze darted between Werrin ’s lifeless body and the High Executioner , who stood frozen , his sword lowered . “
85142	85303	84945	84945	Captain	4115	” Trent closed his eyes , his hand clenching into a fist . He muttered something under his breath — too quiet for anyone to hear — before stepping away from Werrin ’s body , and turning his haunted eyes back to Sibier . Sibier ’s body moved before his mind could catch up . He bolted into the night , the storm swallowing him whole . The rain lashed against his skin , his tears mixing with the downpour . He ’s everywhere , Sibier thought , his chest heaving with sobs . I ca n’t escape him . I ca n’t escape any of it . He did n’t know where he was running . It felt as though the stars themselves had turned their backs on him , leaving him to stumble blindly through the storm . They had given him a second to stand and fight the High Executioner . But once again , he had run .
85322	85341	85342	85343	The Captain	560	“ On every coin there are two sides . One is hidden , and the other is shown . ”
85635	85638	85639	85639	he	31	“ No , ”
85649	85665	85639	85639	he	31	“ I should feel this . I need to feel this . I killed him . ”
85811	85814	85815	85815	Karia	36	“ Trent ! ”
85890	85893	85894	85894	she	36	“ Trent ? ”
85928	85931	85932	85932	he	31	“ Karia … ”
85961	85969	85948	85948	He	31	“ I need to save my family . ”
86002	86009	86010	86010	she	36	“ At what cost , Trent ? ”
86026	86036	86010	86010	she	36	“ Would you sacrifice me to save your family ? ”
86037	86040	86041	86041	Trent	31	“ Karia , ”
86046	86052	86041	86041	Trent	31	“ Do n't go there . ”
86053	86057	86058	86058	she	36	“ Would you ? ”
86072	86077	86078	86078	Trent	31	“ Of course not ! ”
86088	86113	86081	86081	his	31	“ I love you , Karia ! I love you more than anything ! But heavens above , I need to save my family ! ”
86124	86145	86114	86114	His	31	“ They ’re all I have left ! Selean is sick , and I — I have no other choice ! ”
86259	86269	86255	86255	she	36	“ So now you like being Icar ’s puppet ? ”
86292	86295	86296	86296	he	31	“ No , ”
86303	86336	86296	86296	he	31	“ Karia , on the way here , I felt like myself again . Fighting alongside you , saving you — it felt like I was whole again . Like I was … ”
86345	86351	86352	86352	she	36	“ Like what , Trent ? ”
86358	86375	86352	86352	she	36	“ Like a real monster ? Lying to the people you love and killing their friends ? ”
86545	86555	86556	86556	she	36	“ You ’re not the man I fought for , ”
86564	86574	86556	86556	she	36	“ And you ’re not the man I loved . ”
86618	86621	86622	86622	he	31	“ Karia ! ”
86643	86648	86638	86638	She	36	“ Karia , wait ! ”
86682	86697	86672	86672	His	31	“ I ’m scared of who I am when I ’m not with you . ”
86757	86760	86761	86761	Trent	31	“ Karia , ”
86764	86772	86761	86761	Trent	31	“ I need you to save me . ”
86840	86869	86832	86832	he	31	“ Please , Karia . Help me bring back the boy . We can end the Trials . We can save my family . We can save everyone . ”
86890	86914	86877	86877	Trent	31	“ Karia , please do n’t leave ! Please , wo n’t you just save me ? Trent ? The man you love ? ”
87009	87012	87000	87000	Trent	31	“ Karia … ”
87026	87030	87013	87013	His	31	“ Please[bs ] . ”
87127	87134	87138	87138	her	36	“ I ’ll save you Trent , ”
87169	87181	87148	87148	She	36	“ But I ca n’t until you kill the High Executioner . ”
87413	87416	87420	87420	his	46	“ Momma , ”
87429	87434	87420	87420	his	46	“ Do n’t leave ... ”
87523	87528	87529	87529	he	46	“ I miss Momma , ”
87593	87604	87590	87590	Ilyian	46	“ I miss Dadda too . I want them home ! ”
87625	87636	87637	87637	he	31	“ They went to their home before they lived here , ”
87652	87660	87637	87637	he	31	“ They ’re with the stars now . ”
87690	87697	87698	87698	Sibier	31	“ I want to go there . ”
87709	87726	87702	87702	his	31	“ You ca n’t go there yet . Mom and Pa would n’t want you too . ”
87787	87799	87783	87783	Karia	36	“ Sibier ! Are you here ? We need to go ! ”
87867	87874	87875	87875	Sibier	31	“ Can you see them Ilyian , ”
87878	87884	87875	87875	Sibier	31	“ They ’re here too . ”
87885	87889	87890	87890	Ilyian	46	“ I know , ”
87893	87901	87890	87890	Ilyian	46	“ I see them when I sleep . ”
87919	87922	87923	87923	she	36	“ Sibier ! ”
87933	87939	87927	87927	her	36	“ We need to go ! ”
88018	88023	87993	87993	Her	36	“ We ’re here . ”
88066	88072	88073	88073	he	31	“ Hear that , Ily ? ”
88079	88084	88073	88073	he	31	“ We made it . ”
88085	88088	88089	88089	Terit	51	“ Finally , ”
88606	88621	88599	88600	No one	341	“ We ’ll build a kingdom as if it resided in the stars itself . ”
88651	88659	88660	88660	Terit	51	“ What a blasted mess this is , ”
88686	88700	88670	88670	He	51	“ This place has got fifty rooms and not a single blasted bathtub . ”
88761	88766	88767	88767	Terit	51	“ And this view ? ”
88777	88790	88767	88767	Terit	51	“ Blocked by all this blasted seaweed . And it smells like — ”
88791	88794	88795	88795	Sibier	31	“ Yorin , ”
88815	88830	88810	88810	he	54	“ Can you watch Ilyian for a bit ? I need some fresh air . ”
89124	89134	89135	89135	Yorin	54	“ Consider him safe and sound until you return , ”
89157	89168	89169	89169	he	54	“ May you grow up to see the stars light , ”
89243	89255	89240	89240	Terit	51	“ Hmm , back to the fancies of crazed old men . ”
90433	90436	90437	90437	he	31	“ Here , ”
90444	90448	90440	90440	his	31	“ take this . ”
90476	90483	90484	90484	she	2229	“ Please … leave me alone , ”
90590	90599	90605	90605	his	31	“ I do n’t want to hurt you , ”
90622	90633	90611	90611	He	31	“ Please . You need this more than I do . ”
90670	90676	90666	90666	her	2226	“ What do you want ? ”
90693	90697	90698	90698	he	31	“ Right now ? ”
90703	90711	90698	90698	he	31	“ What I want does n’t matter . ”
90723	90732	90712	90712	His	31	“ Has anyone asked you what you want ? ”
90751	90754	90755	90755	she	2229	“ No , ”
91018	91032	91004	91004	Her	2229	“ Why are you out here ? This is n’t where people live . ”
91043	91052	91053	91053	he	31	“ I could ask you the same thing , ”
91062	91067	91053	91053	he	31	“ Answer my question . ”
91107	91114	91115	91115	he	31	“ I came here for safety , ”
91178	91191	91192	91192	he	31	“ You have n’t been out here very long , have you ? ”
91205	91209	91195	91195	She	2229	“ Same here , ”
91213	91225	91226	91226	His	31	“ My parents … they were murdered nearly two months ago . ”
91244	91251	91226	91226	His	31	“ I understand how this feels . ”

95160	95165	95151	95151	He	31	“ Let me go . ”

97053	97060	97061	97061	he	51	“ Tastes worse than it smells , ”
97076	97086	97073	97073	Sibier	31	“ You 're supposed to cook it , dimwits . ”

98143	98159	98160	98160	He	31	“ As a token of what I offer , I have brought you a gift . ”
98181	98195	98160	98160	He	31	“ Food from a source so vast that we could never exhaust it . ”
98237	98244	98245	98245	Sibier	31	“ Please , take a piece , ”
98257	98265	98245	98245	Sibier	31	“ I ’m giving this all away . ”
98294	98297	98298	98299	A woman	2475	“ Please ! ”
98311	98320	98298	98299	A woman	2475	“ My husband ’s fishery has run dry . ”
98358	98372	98347	98347	Others	4067	“ The kingdom tithes stole what we had left to eat days ago ! ”
98373	98388	98340	98345	a burly man with wild eyes	2476	“ Our fields are nutrient deprived . We ca n’t grow our food anymore ! ”
98389	98397	98347	98347	Others	4067	“ Please , my children are starving ! ”
98398	98434	98347	98347	Others	4067	“ Give me more ! ’ Sibier ’s pulse quickened . The crowd swelled around him , arms grabbing and pulling . A hand clamped around his wrist , trying to yank the bag away . “
98437	98466	98347	98347	Others	4067	” Sibier shouted , his voice hoarse . He tugged the bag back , and the frenzy stilled slightly . Breathing heavily , he raised his free hand . “
98500	98525	98478	98478	I	0	” Murmurs rippled through the crowd . A few faces lit up with cautious hope , but doubt lingered in amongst the entire group . “
98532	98588	98528	98528	we	2481	” a voice demanded from the back . Sibier ’s throat tightened , but he looked to the stars , and took a deep breath . Then , he rolled down his cursed sleeve , revealing his cursed arm . Violet veins pulsed faintly against his skin . The sight was both mesmerizing and unnerving . “
98595	98655	98592	98593	The Survivor	2482	” A shocked silence fell over the crowd , their disbelief palpable . Whispers spread like wildfire . Some stared at him as though he were a divine answer , while others recoiled . Then a woman from the crowd stepped forward , her legs wobbling as she approached . She dropped to her knees , her gaze heavenward . “
98663	98701	98702	98702	I	0	” Taking a deep breath , Sibier continued , feeling shaky . Do the stars condemn me for this ? Was what he said blasphemy ? He was n’t sure , but he had to press forward . “
98710	98711	98712	98712	He	2485	” “
98715	98731	98712	98712	He	2485	” Sibier whirled around , scanning the crowd . His heart thudded in his chest . “
98742	98778	98735	98740	this man with the High Executioner	2486	” the voice continued . Sibier was able to pick him out : a tall , broad figure with lips too fat for his face and eyes so sunken they looked like empty coin pouches . “
98797	98810	98787	98787	He	2485	” The crowd stirred uneasily , confusion and anger spreading like poison . “
98818	98826	98827	98828	The man	466	” Sibier shouted , his voice desperate . “
98832	98833	98827	98828	The man	466	” “
98857	98858	98859	98859	He	466	” “
98871	98892	98859	98859	He	466	” another voice called out . A wiry man pushed to the front , waving a parchment in his hand . “
98908	98914	98896	98897	the King	186	” Sibier ’s stomach dropped . “
98917	98925	98896	98897	the King	186	” he gasped . His voice faltered . “
98933	98980	98926	98926	I	0	” His words however were too late : the crowd erupted in chaos . People shoved and screamed , fear and rage mixing . Hands clawed at Sibier , pulling at his hands and limbs . Someone grabbed the corner of his bag , yanking him . “
98983	99014	98926	98926	I	0	” Sibier cried , kicking back . Someone yanked hard on the corner of his bag , and it tore open . Seaweed scattered across the ground , trampled underfoot . “
99021	99054	98926	98926	I	0	” But his voice was lost in the commotion . The crowd surged and pushed , a wild , unrelenting beast . Sibier ’s pulse raced as he fought to stay upright . “
99057	99065	98926	98926	I	0	” he shouted , his voice raw . “
99070	99124	98926	98926	I	0	” But the chaos only deepened . Faces blurred into a frenzied mass . The press of bodies closed in , sweat and panic mingling into an oppressive heat . He scanned desperately for Karia , Yorin , Selean — anyone — but saw only a writhing sea of arms and desperate faces . “
99128	99140	98926	98926	I	0	” Kingdom guards shouted , their shields battering through the mob . “
99146	99161	99220	99220	Sibier	31	” Swords glinted in the flickering light . Sibier ’s heart pounded only faster . “
99165	99169	99220	99220	Sibier	31	” he cried . “
99178	99182	99220	99220	Sibier	31	” Who was its ?
99289	99296	99297	99298	a guard	348	“ Get up , you urchin , ”
99388	99394	99395	99395	Selean	35	“ Let me at him ! ”
99404	99412	99401	99401	his	54	“ You ’ll only get yourself arrested . ”
99447	99450	99438	99438	He	31	“ Sibier , ”
99558	99563	99564	99564	she	36	“ Is he okay ? ”
99568	99573	99574	99574	she	36	“ Is he ok ? ”
99593	99601	99602	99602	she	36	“ The head wound is n't bad , ”
99605	99616	99602	99602	she	36	“ He just needs to snap out of the shock . ”
99637	99642	99643	99643	he	31	“ I ’m fine , ”
99703	99708	99709	99709	he	31	“ No , seriously , ”
99718	99723	99709	99709	he	31	“ I ’m fine . ”
99730	99737	99724	99724	He	31	“ Where ’s Terit and Yorin ? ”
99738	99746	99747	99747	Karia	36	“ They went back to the hideout , ”
99770	99785	99760	99760	Her	36	“ Terit stormed off to grab more seaweed so he would n’t be hungry . ”
99883	99886	99887	99887	she	35	“ Here , ”
99890	99895	99887	99887	she	35	“ you ’re shivering . ”
99938	99941	99927	99927	He	31	“ Thanks . ”
100065	100069	100070	100070	he	31	“ Did anyone … ”
100112	100117	100106	100106	Sibier	31	“ Did anyone die ? ”
100132	100135	100136	100136	she	35	“ No , ”
100139	100148	100136	100136	she	35	“ Luckily the guards broke it apart quickly . ”
100188	100193	100194	100194	Sibier	31	“ We should go , ”
100197	100206	100194	100194	Sibier	31	“ We ’ve already been here too long . ”
100219	100223	100207	100207	Karia	36	“ I agree . ”
100272	100275	100276	100276	Sibier	31	“ Thanks , ”
100346	100349	100343	100343	someone	992	“ You . ”
100377	100388	100365	100365	Karia	36	“ Do you have any more of that green stuff ? ”
100462	100475	100454	100455	his father	275	“ Everyone must be able to come . Everyone must be invited . ”
100499	100507	100508	100508	he	31	“ We do n’t have any more , ”
100511	100520	100508	100508	he	31	“ But we know how to get some . ”
100527	100530	100524	100524	her	2533	“ How ? ”
100531	100537	100538	100538	Sibier	31	“ We ’re building something , ”
100541	100567	100568	100569	The lady	2533	“ A safehaven of sorts . A place where we can be free from the Kingdom , and a place where we will have food . ”
100572	100591	100568	100569	The lady	2533	“ Son , you expect me to believe that ? You ’re dumber than a pile of rocks . ”
100614	100622	100623	100623	she	35	“ He ’s serious . Believe it , ”
100643	100651	100632	100633	The Lady	2533	“ Who are you ? His pet ? ”
100652	100659	100660	100660	Selean	35	“ I am not His pet ! ”
100776	100779	100780	100780	Sibier	31	“ Listen , ”
100783	100816	100780	100780	Sibier	31	“ I know you ’ve been taken advantage of before . But we ’re not here to do that . We have something great , and you can be part of it . ”
100833	100845	100822	100822	her	2533	“ What are you trying to use me for , boy ? ”
100855	100864	100865	100865	He	31	“ I ’m not going to use you ! ”
100876	100908	100865	100865	He	31	“ We have a safehold from the kingdom where we are building a sanctuary . There 's a need for people like you to work for food and build a community . ”
100915	100920	100912	100912	her	2533	“ You ’re ridiculous . ”
100924	100930	100921	100921	Sibier	31	“ Follow me and see . ”
100931	100959	100960	100960	Sibier	31	“ Even if your blasted sanctuary existed , I would n't stay . I ’d turn you over the guards for reward . Leave me alone boy . ”
100982	100989	100974	100974	he	31	“ Maam , are you sure ? ”
100990	100997	100998	100998	she	2533	“ To the depths with you ! ”
101001	101009	100998	100998	she	2533	“ Let me have my peace already ! ”
101986	101994	101995	101995	he	31	“ I ca n’t do it anymore , ”
102011	102018	101998	101998	He	31	“ I ca n't do it . “
102023	102378	102379	102379	Moma	99	” Soaked with tears , Trent felt the familiar scabbard beneath his fingers . Miserably , he withdrew the knife , shaking with fervor . It would be quick . His death would be painless , trivial to the consuming abyss that devoured from the inside . The world would be a better place without him . He saw his dark hair in the reflection , his sharp features staring back at himself with a hollow gaze . If he died here , who would miss him ? Surely the kingdom would cheer with his death and be a happier place without him casting about his darkness . He would be free : free from it all . No more pain ; no more death . Only silence — joyous , calm , unheard silence . He watched his nose crinkled as he cried , just like his mother ’s would have . His face was unearthly pale , ashen grey . He only imagined Selean ’s would be the same as her sickness brought her close to death . Trent ’s sickness , however , would prevail . His sickness would take his life . He lifted the knife , looking away . Trent could n’t watch — he did n’t deserve to die honorably . For the last time , he glanced up through the shattered roof at the stars : so distant , so far away . Had they ever been here for him ? Had the skies really ever returned his praise , ever helped him for all the times he thanked them for ? He felt so sunken in his dread , that it seemed impossible . He was too far for even divinity to help him . Was there anyone he was n’t dead to already ? The kingdom already thought that . He would only be doing them a favor . A young girl stepped through the doorway , meeting Trent ’s eyes briefly before having them dart at her feet . Dirt rusted her face , as she held her hands together , tentatively but hopeful . “
102397	102661	102662	102662	Moma	99	” She glanced up , looking at Trent quickly , and giving a sly smile . She held her hands behind her back , as she nervously shifted from foot to foot . Trent ’s heart broke . Here he was , High Executioner , traitor and murderer , and here stood a little girl — no older than five — comforting him . He dropped the knife . All his energy seemed sucked away from him , as if drawn into a violent vortex . After all his years of fighting , of rallying men and thousands of inspirational speeches . After all of the accolades , of the pats on the back , and hopeful smiles . After all he had learned , after all of his praise , and all of the advice he had ever heard , it took a girl to say it . To tell him he is stupid . For him to realize he was wrong . For him to realize he needed to forgive himself , and for him to realize he needed to get moving . Guilt is not meant to stay . Sorrow is not meant to be chronic . Fear is not meant to be held . No . They are meant to be temporary , to spur growth to fix what had been broken . He need not drown in them . Heavens above , it was time to swim . Trent stood , turning to the doorway . The girl shyly waddled towards him , giving him a childish hug . “
102670	102758	102662	102662	Moma	99	” She smiled . Trent smirked , amazed by the innocence . His heart darkened momentarily , as he thought about the stars the girl would later collect . No one could avoid them . Definitely not a little girl as innocent as she . Skies , he used to fight for a better future for people like her . Trent swallowed . I want to do that again . I want to do that again . That little girl did n’t deserve a life counting scars . “
102761	102784	102662	102662	Moma	99	” The girl said happily , playfully running out of the room . Then she burst back in a few moments later . “
102806	103120	103121	103121	He	2592	” She handed out a piece of dried seaweed to him . Shocked , Trent took the tiny bunch of seaweed from the girl . Then , she was out again . Frozen in place , Trent let the contagious feeling warm him . He was so close to breaking , but he had to save his family . There was something still in this world for him . He could feel it . Grabbing the last of the diapers , Trent shoved them down his trench coat . Sibier would need them , and even though Trent had to bring him back to the Trials , at least he could do this one service . He could reclaim a part of who he was . He strode out to find out who this person was the girl was talking about . It did n’t take long . He could hear the awe of the crowd the moment he stepped out of the door . As he turned down into the street , Trent saw what he never thought he would imagine . A crowd -- maybe thirty hundred people -- stood gathered around a boy standing on an empty fish crate . A hush had come over him , as they stood mesmerized by Sibier . It was easy to tell why the crowd had gathered . Sibier stood with his sleeves rolled up fulling exposing his curse . The crowd was stunned . They hung onto each of Sibier ’s words as he talked about how the stars had saved him , and how something new was coming . Something grand . Trent stepped closer , sticking to the shadows . The ocean breeze blew the stink of the crowd , smelling like dry fish and mildew . He eyes looked among those in the crowd , trying to read lips . “
103128	103360	103121	103121	He	2592	” one whispered . And then he spotted Karia . She just infront of Sibier , pushing back the crowd . Even from where he stood , Trent could make out the sagging darness beneath her eyes , and could see the tension in her shoulders . He knew that it was n’t the crowd giving her stress . Trent ’s heart sank . He wanted more than anything to go to her and ask what was bothering her . Deep inside , he knew it was him . Trent stepped a little closer , trying to get a better view of Karia . It was hard with the bustling of the crowd . Whispers muttered through them , but they did n’t seem excited , but doubtful . Trent ’s eyes met Karia ’s . Her face stiffened , and then she disappeared into the crowd . Skies , how am I ever going to earn her forgiveness ? He exhaled , feeling the cloth absentmindedly in his coat pocket . His mind went to Icar , to his family , to Karia and then back to Icar . Then the High Executioner strode forward . _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ Chapter Something[cd ] or Another A star in the sky shine the brightest when the night is at its Darkest

103682	103689	103678	103679	The crowd	1184	“ I want my family back . ”

103708	103715	103716	103716	Trent	31	“ Then I ’ll avenge them . ”
103808	103817	103800	103800	Trent	31	“ These are for your brother , Sibier . ”

103861	103870	103871	103871	Trent	31	“ I need you to come with me , ”
103888	103898	103883	103883	he	31	“ Please , we do n’t need a fight . ”
103996	104005	104006	104006	Sibier	31	“ Just come with me Sibier . Please . ”
104011	104030	104006	104006	Sibier	31	“ I am not coming with you . I wo n’t let down these people like you have . ”
104031	104034	104035	104035	Trent	31	“ Kid , ”
104042	104051	104035	104035	Trent	31	“ I do n’t want to do this . ”
104074	104078	104079	104079	he	31	“ I do , ”
104083	104091	104079	104079	he	31	“ I do want to do this . ”

104123	104139	104120	104120	he	31	“ do n’t fall as I did , Sibier . Never learn how to kill . ”
104198	104208	104209	104209	Trent	31	“ I hope for you to kill me here , ”
104267	104273	104274	104274	Trent	31	“ How naive I was , ”
104285	104307	104308	104308	he	31	“ Just like you are . So bold , so willing to do good , so wishing to sacrifice for others … ”
104317	104391	104308	104308	he	31	“ All good things , excellent even , but I was also a fool . Confidence , brilliance , boasting — it all comes with a cost , Sibier . It grew inside my shadow , but I was never wise enough to look back and remember . Remember who I was . Remember what I came from and remember why . Why I sacrificed . Why was I willing to do good ? ”
104412	104431	104405	104405	He	31	“ It 's not about you . It 's not about me . It 's not about them . ”
104445	104455	104437	104437	Sibier	31	“ Then what is it all about , traitor ? ”
104469	104475	104476	104476	he	31	“ I do n’t know , ”
104479	104485	104476	104476	he	31	“ I do n’t know . ”
104492	104505	104506	104506	Trent	31	“ You killed my parents for a reason you did n’t know ? ”
104512	104531	104506	104506	Trent	31	“ I did n’t kill for no reason . It was the only way to save my family . ”
104532	104540	104541	104541	Sibier	31	“ TO THE DEPTHS WITH YOUR FAMILY , ”
104565	104596	104553	104553	Trent	31	“ King Icar tells me your parents lasted long into the trials . With their last words they spoke of how they trusted their son to carry on their legacy . ”
104704	104712	104692	104692	Trent	31	“ You ’re coming with me kid . ”
104713	104716	104717	104717	Someone	992	“ Stop ! ”
104787	104793	104794	104794	He	31	“ What s your name ? ”
104797	104802	104803	104804	the man	466	“ I ’m Yorin , ”
104813	104817	104818	104818	Trent	31	“ Leave Yorion , ”

104851	104863	104847	104847	he	54	“ Sibier is the prophesied ! You ca n’t take him . ”
104864	104872	104847	104847	he	54	“ Are you going to stop me ? ”
104917	104920	104901	104901	Yorin	54	“ Yes . ”
104946	104949	104950	104950	Trent	31	“ Why ? ”
104970	104980	104950	104950	Trent	31	“ Why are you forfeiting your life for his ? ”
104993	105002	104984	104984	Yorin	54	“ Because he has treated me like family . ”
105291	105298	105305	105305	he	384	“ You 're out of time , ”
105394	105398	105391	105391	his	42	“ Trent STOP ! ”

105802	105816	105788	105788	Terit	51	“ Only fair that the weapon that took Yorin will also take him . ”
105905	105912	105895	105895	Terit	51	“ To the depths with you . ”
105918	105921	105922	105922	she	35	“ Stop ! ”
105933	105939	105940	105940	Terit	51	“ Do n’t kill him ! ”
105954	105962	105963	105963	Terit	51	“ Get out of my way girl , ”
105986	105993	105994	105994	Selean	35	“ You do n’t know him , ”
106001	106010	105997	105997	her	35	“ Please , do n’t kill my brother ! ”
106162	106165	106166	106166	Selean	35	“ Sibier ! ”
106454	106460	106443	106443	He	31	“ Who will follow me ? ”
107138	107155	107134	107134	she	35	“ The Survivor bested him . Under his lead , we will forge a new kingdom . ”
107496	107500	107493	107493	Icar	32	“ You failed . ”
107501	107508	107509	107509	Trent	31	“ Do n't speak to me , ”
107761	107770	107771	107771	Icar	32	“ Trent , tell me how you feel , ”
107775	107780	107781	107781	Trent	31	“ Leave me alone , ”
107828	107862	107822	107823	King Icar	32	“ I can see your not committed enough to this kingdom . Maybe you would like a demonstration with your family ? You betrayed my trust ... is it time I betray yours ? ”
107875	107879	107880	107880	Icar	32	“ Speak girl , ”
107891	107894	107895	107895	Trent	31	“ Son . ”
107939	107942	107943	107943	Trent	31	“ Mom ? ”
107972	107987	107968	107968	Icar	32	“ We are running out of time Trent . I need your full commitment . ”
108175	108185	108186	108186	Icar	32	“ I ’m not going to kill her Trent . ”
108197	108208	108186	108186	Icar	32	“ I ’m not going to kill any of them . ”
108245	108248	108249	108249	Trent	31	“ Mom , ”
108256	108261	108262	108262	She	196	“ Are you ok . ”
108280	108301	108273	108273	Her	196	“ I should be aking you that , Trent . I ca n’t imagine what Icar has made you do … ”
108312	108322	108273	108273	Her	196	“ I do n’t want to dwell on that . ”
108323	108330	108273	108273	Her	196	“ I ’m proud of you . ”
108358	108380	108348	108348	He	31	“ Thank you mom . I ’ve made so many mistakes , but I ’m trying . Trying to stay true . ”
108386	108404	108348	108348	He	31	“ Son , there are terrible things coming . I know you hate the king , but … ”
108415	108430	108412	108412	she	2152	“ ... but for yours to come , you have to listen to Icar . ”
108474	108484	108469	108469	Icar	32	“ I did n’t ask her to say that . ”
108497	108505	108487	108487	Trent	31	“ Mom , what do you mean ? ”
108540	108560	108517	108517	her	2152	“ Trent , horrible things are coming . Icar showed us . He is going to need your help . ”
108576	108583	108517	108517	her	2152	“ What-- What do you mean ? ”
108584	108587	108588	108588	she	2152	“ Trent , ”
108595	108617	108588	108588	she	2152	“ If you do n’t succeed here , it 's not just us that will die . The whole kingdom will . ”
108639	108654	108632	108632	he	31	“ You ’re going to have to forgive them for letting your brother die . ”
108686	108692	108693	108693	He	31	“ I ca n’t mom . ”
108723	108732	108709	108710	His mom	2152	“ Trent , its what he would want . ”
108782	108812	108773	108773	Icar	32	“ Trent , I need you to understand this . I wo n’t kill you your family if you fail again , but know your family will not survive . ”
108848	108857	108841	108841	Icar	32	“ We caught a Darkened Dawn spy today . ”
108882	108886	108887	108887	He	32	“ So what ? ”
108890	108911	108912	108912	He	32	“ Do n’t be slow , Trent . The Darkened Dawn is looking to steal back the food we stole . ”
108917	108941	108912	108912	He	32	“ It almost feels like the spy had wanted to be captured . Its like she wants us to know what s coming . ”
108950	108966	108942	108942	Trent	31	“ Ca n’t we just give it to the people ? Why hold onto it ? ”
108980	109022	109023	109023	Trent	31	“ We ca n’t Trent . The tithes this year have dropped . We need that food for the tribute to buy us time to figure out the Trials . It ’s the only thing keeping the Heti from destroying us . ”
109038	109042	109043	109043	she	196	“ Listen son , ”
109051	109069	109070	109070	Icar	32	“ We ’re getting close to solving the Trials . The blow to your head is telling , ”
109073	109120	109070	109070	Icar	32	“ Your skin is scarred with power . Of course it 's too trace to mean any significant , but it does mean the Trials partially worked for the boy -- his punch has left you falling in - and - out of consciousness for days . ”
109148	109159	109160	109160	Icar	32	“ We almost have what we want from the Trials , ”
109162	109203	109160	109160	Icar	32	“ but that success is unraveling us . In just the last few days , the word of what the boy has done has spread like wildfire . The entire kingdom is in unrest , mobbings are becoming to commonplace . ”
109223	109266	109212	109212	he	32	“ We do n’t have enough men to manage all of the riots . Even some of the lords are withdrawing their support , looking into these rumored promises of food and wealth from the boy . Our kingdom is falling apart . ”
109267	109275	109276	109276	Trent	31	“ The kingdom was always falling apart , ”
109279	109286	109276	109276	Trent	31	“ With you at its head . ”
109296	109300	109301	109301	she	196	“ Listen son , ”
109322	109341	109306	109306	Icar	32	“ I do n’t understand how you of all people were gifted with your talent by the stars . ”
109381	109437	109438	109438	Icar	32	“ No matter the consequence , we must pay tribute to the Heti to buy us an extra year to solve the Trials . That brings me the dilemma Trent . Somehow , someway , we need to protect the food we have from the Darkened Dawn . And that ’s why I need you . ”
109448	109507	109443	109443	his	32	“ I ca n’t give you much men -- almost all of routes back to our kingdom have been destroyed or made inaccessible by the riots , making troop movement impossible . But you know better than anyone the weaknesses in this kingdom . No one can do a better job than you . Protect the food Trent . ”
109555	109563	109564	109564	Trent	31	“ How many men do I get , ”
109573	109581	109567	109567	Icar	32	“ Thirty , plus my personal gaurd . ”
109791	109795	109796	109796	he	31	“ Your ok , ”
109799	109807	109796	109796	he	31	“ He ’s like this with everyone . ”
110085	110091	110092	110092	she	115	“ Pardon me , sir , ”
110095	110114	110092	110092	she	115	“ I ’m going to try to boil some of this to see if it could taste better . ”
110139	110143	110144	110144	he	31	“ Good luck , ”
110147	110155	110144	110144	he	31	“ Let me know how it works . ”
110156	110160	110161	110161	Clover	115	“ I will , ”
110367	110372	110353	110353	Selean	35	“ Who is it ? ”
110373	110380	110394	110394	Sibier	31	“ It ’s me . Sibier . ”
110389	110393	110394	110394	Sibier	31	“ Come in . ”
110593	110598	110599	110599	Sibier	31	“ Are you ok ? ”
110626	110632	110618	110618	Sibier	31	“ Do you forgive me ? ”
110642	110652	110653	110653	She	35	“ I came back here , did n’t I ? ”
110672	110683	110662	110662	She	35	“ Why did you have to cut off his hand ! ”
110725	110733	110734	110734	She	35	“ He killed my family , Selean . ”
110739	110742	110736	110736	her	35	“ So ? ”
110754	110766	110736	110736	her	35	“ I would ’ve killed him if it was n’t for you-- ”
110767	110777	110778	110778	Selean	35	“ Then you 're no better than he is , ”
110781	110787	110778	110778	Selean	35	“ Why are you here ? ”
110815	110825	110826	110826	he	46	“ I want to make things right between us , ”
110830	110842	110826	110826	he	46	“ I ’m hurting Selean . This does n’t feel right . ”
110843	110848	110849	110849	Sibier	31	“ Then fix it . ”
110852	110863	110849	110849	Sibier	31	“ Really ? What do you think I ’m doing ? ”
110876	110890	110864	110864	Selean	35	“ Your wasting what you got . Crush the Kingdom with this rebellion . ”
110899	110956	110896	110896	Selean	35	“ I left my family to finish what my brother started . I hate him for betraying the kingdom , but he saved me the blasted fool . I owe it to him to save him now from the kingdom , and to burn it all down . He deserves vengeance . I deserve it too . ”
110977	110986	110968	110968	she	35	“ I … This is n’t a rebellion ! ”
110987	111003	111004	111004	Selean	35	“ Then why did I bother spreading the word to get so many people here ? ”
111015	111033	111004	111004	Selean	35	“ We have everything we need . People are coming . We have Karia to lead us . ”
111041	111048	111049	111049	he	31	“ This is n’t a rebellion , ”
111057	111068	111049	111049	he	31	“ That s not what my parents would have wanted . ”
111069	111083	111084	111084	Selean	35	“ You said you wanted to ‘ make things right between us ’ , ”
111087	111104	111084	111084	Selean	35	“ Well this is it . Stop being such a blasted coward and free this people ! ”
111139	111146	111147	111147	he	31	“ I ’m not a coward , ”
111182	111191	111179	111179	her	35	“ You are a lot like my brother . ”
111207	111210	111213	111213	Sibier	31	“ Sibier ! ”
111253	111260	111261	111261	Terit	51	“ This is working , Sibier , ”
111359	111368	111369	111370	the Vagrant	505	“ With the six of us taking shifts , ”
111373	111405	111369	111370	the Vagrant	505	“ we are able to collect enough blasted seaweed for thirty people in a week in a single day . We could sustain a few more people than what we have . ”
111406	111409	111410	111410	Sibier	31	“ Excellent , ”
111476	111489	111466	111466	Terit	51	“ Sibier , there is something else we need to talk about . ”
111551	111555	111556	111556	Sibier	31	“ Of course , ”
111559	111564	111556	111556	Sibier	31	“ What is it ? ”
111659	111672	111650	111650	Terit	51	“ It 's my fault Yorin ’s dead , is n’t it . ”
111718	111741	111714	111714	his	51	“ I should have been the one to pick up your fallen sword . Yorin deserved his life — I do not . ”
111813	111826	111797	111797	his	51	“ If I had your power , I could have saved him . ”
111836	111839	111840	111840	Sibier	31	“ Terit , ”
111843	111857	111858	111858	Rounding	117	“ do not blame yourself for this . It is not your fault . ”
111870	111878	111866	111866	Terit	51	“ It is my fault , Sibier ! ”
111886	111953	111954	111954	Sibier	31	“ Skies , ca n’t you see it ? Yorin was always the one carrying my weight . He was always the one urging us to do better , and always the one blasted swine that got up and tried again . There was a reason he came to your defense and I stood still . Now , he 's dead . Because of my idiocracy . ”
111992	112004	111977	111977	he	31	“ Do you ever wonder why Yorin always stuck with you ? ”
112005	112011	112014	112014	his	31	“ Because I cheated him . ”
112025	112036	112037	112037	Terit	51	“ It 's because he saw something good within you . ”

112074	112077	112078	112078	Sibier	31	“ No , ”
112081	112133	112078	112078	Sibier	31	“ it ’s because deep down you hold that same goodness . You lifted him up in ways you do n’t understand ; out of the two of you , were n’t you always the one leading ? Talking your way through the slums , cursing your way around the streets ? ”
112134	112144	112145	112145	Terit	51	“ Yeah , and see where that got us , ”
112153	112189	112145	112145	Terit	51	“ All I ever did was a facade . Fake , with no real value . Skies ! Anyone can talk — anyone can curse — but not everyone can be the friend Yorin was . ”

112203	112223	112200	112200	Sibier	31	“ Maybe what you have is just hidden from you . Maybe not even you understand who you are . ”
112229	112234	112235	112235	he	31	“ Then who does ? ”
112294	112300	112301	112301	Sibier	31	“ No one truly understands , ”
112304	112363	112301	112301	Sibier	31	“ and that 's the joy of it all . Only you get to discover who you are , only you get to define what you want to be . Yorin may have seen your potential , but your destiny is yours . Look at the path you are already on : you 're leading a new coalition . ”
112364	112373	112374	112374	Sibier	31	“ But Yorin could have done it better . ”

115243	115252	115237	115237	She	36	“ How many men do you have here ? ”
115275	115295	115296	115296	Shem	122	“ Where is Werrin ? When Karia did n’t speak , Sibier ’s heart pounded faster in his chest . “
115298	115305	115306	115306	He	122	” Karia gave a quick nod . “
115310	115422	115306	115306	He	122	” she whispered , the words coming out only briefly before whisked away by the wind . Nearly haunting with its teasing volume . Selean gasped , covering her mouth , even though she did n’t know Shem or Werrin . Sibier blinked , his arms dropping to his side . He had suspected as much , but he had to know . And now he did . Skies . More men had died for this cause — lives that could never be replaced . At least their sacrifice was being honored . It did not warm his chilled heart . The peace he had felt tonight would not be reclaimed . “
115427	115461	115425	115425	them	2918	” Karia sniffed , fighting back tears . Despite being only twenty - two , the warrior had the loving tenacity of a mother : her compassion far exceeded what Sibier ever expected . “
115471	115478	115479	115479	I	0	” She choked , stifling sobs . “
115483	115658	115479	115479	I	0	” She used to love Werrin ? Shem ? Momentarily , the despair inside shifted to let confusion through . Sibier furrowed his brow , still biting back tears . Werrin and Shem were dead . And it was his fault . How many people had died for him ? Too much ... He felt as though his boots were sinking into tar , dragging him down . The sorrow clung to him , rooted him firmly in place . It took too much to step out of it : he wanted to lay down and let the sorrow envelop him . Sibier squared his jaws , tensing . He could n’t do that . He could n’t let anyone else die . He could n’t lose himself to that tar . He had made a promise to his parents . He would do it . Clenching his fists , he felt his resolve harden . I would make sure of it . Pushing her emotions to the side , Karia steeled her voice . “
115682	115789	115790	115790	We	2921	” Sibier balked . What ! So much was going so well for his community right now ; he was n’t going to throw that all away ! In the end , the solution did n’t come from overthrowing the government , but learning to live apart from it . So far , the kingdom ignored them , and so Sibier ignored the throne . No need in throwing away any lives . No one else needed to join his parent ’s sacrifice . Shem ’s and Werrin ’s sacrifice . Skies , so many had died already . Karia continued , sensing Sibier ’s surprise . “

115823	115827	115819	115819	we	2921	” Sibier rejected . “
115835	115846	115828	115828	We	2921	” he gestured with his arms to the rebel base . “
115854	115860	115819	115819	we	2921	” Karia ’s jaw dropped . “
115925	115948	115949	115949	I	0	” Selean cast her eyes to the dirt , secluding herself from the conversation as Sibier ’s and Karia ’s voices rose . “
115995	116053	116054	116054	I	0	” Briefly , Sibier ’s mom and dad popped into his head . Quickly , he shoved them from his mind . He could n’t deal with that pain . Not now . A wave of regret splashed across Karia , as she glanced down in shame . Her voice curled with guilt , her tone battered . “
116094	116225	116226	116226	Karia	36	” Sibier wanted to comfort her , to tell her it was alright , but he could n’t . He was mad — frustrated even . She did n’t come to tell him that Shem and Werrin had died , but instead requested that the people in his community give up their lives for a useless war . Requesting that his people give away their first real opportunity . She was requesting beggars to aid those who had scoffed at their need . To fight their war . That is why she came , and her audacity stung Sibier . No , he was n’t going to comfort her . Skies , he was mad . He kept his voice even , doing his best to ferret out all anger . “
116241	116301	116226	116226	Karia	36	” He left no room to question . Turning on his heels , Sibier stalked away . After all , he needed to make sure Ilyian did n’t choke on the moss ball Swine had given him . _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ Chapter Twenty - Eight A New Chapter

117958	117961	117955	117955	Sibier	120	“ Wait ! ”

120506	120667	120499	120499	we	3028	” The crowd cheered , voices lifting high into the sky . Many of them had spent years rotting on the streets , waiting for an opportunity like this : to strike back , to make something out of their lives . And now Sibier offered it to them . But in the back of his mind , he still felt it . The foreboding anxiety — the fear that they would lose everything . Wars came with a heavy cost , and Sibier doubted he had enough to pay it . But as he looked back into the crowd — seeing the fearful men , the quivering vagrants and broken warriors all standing together , tall and defiant — Sibier felt his confidence surge . Maybe they did have enough . He rolled back both sleeves , revealing his curse . A gasp snaked through the crowd , shock rolling up their faces . They were n’t expecting this . “
120684	120694	120675	120675	their	3043	” Sibier grew quiet , almost deadly with reminiscence . “
